contact details are normally on the trader's website. Tell them they've failed to comply with EU or national law, and ask them to resolve the problem. You can refer them to their obligations, as summarised on this page. It's always a good idea to back up your claim with evidence (invoice, contract, etc.). If this approach doesn't work, consider taking the matter further. Sample story Customer service teams can often solve your complaint Jutta, from Germany, was dissatisfied with her internet connection speed, which was lower than that stated in her contract. She contacted her internet provider to complain, which prompted them to increase their connection speed. Jutta didn't need to take any further action. If you and the trader cannot settle your contractual dispute directly, the trader has to inform you about further steps, such as: filing a formal complaint initiating alternative dispute resolution procedures Choose country: Austria*at Belgiumbeen Bulgaria*bg Croatia*cr Cypruscyen Czechiaczen Denmarkdken Estoniaeeen Finland*fi France*fr Germanydeen Greecegren Hungaryhuen Irelandieen Italyiten Latvialven Lithuanialten Luxembourgluen Maltamten Netherlands*nl Norway*no Poland*pl Portugal*pt Romania*ro Slovakia*sk Slovenia*si Spain*es Sweden*se * Information not yet available. Still have questions? Search terms Contact a consumer organisation or regulatory authority Consumer organisations in your country can usually also: provide more information on your rights take action to help you enforce them If you have a problem with a service provider, you can also contact the competent national regulatory authorities. Each sector has its own national regulatory authorities, whose specific remit may vary from country to country. Many regulatory authorities have specific procedures for service providers in their sector and can resolve disputes fairly and quickly. Find out more about: national regulatory authorities in the electronic communications sector national regulatory authorities/Ombudsmen in the energy sector national regulatory authorities in the financial sector European Consumer Centres If you have any problems when purchasing goods or services abroad in the EU, Norway or Iceland, contact one of the European Consumer Centres (ECC-net). These centres can: tell you about your rights under EU law and national consumer legislation advise you on possible ways of following up your consumer complaint help you reach an amicable settlement with traders abroad from whom you have purchased goods or services, whether online or face to face redirect you to an appropriate body if the ECC-Net can't help European Consumer Centres can help you free of charge if: you have a problem with a trader based in another EU country you have already complained to the trader in writing you are complaining as an individual, not on behalf of a company Sample story Sofia, from Portugal, bought a laptop from a Spainish online retailer. Unfortunately, when the laptop arrived she discovered that it didn't work properly. The trader advised her to send it back to the manufacturer for repair. She did so, but it wasn't long before she had the same problem again. Sofia contacted the trader again to ask for a refund, but was told this wouldn't be considered until the laptop had been repaired 3 times. She decided to contact ECC Portugal for help. The Portuguese office shared the case with its counterpart in Spain, which contacted the trader. Following the intervention of the Spanish ECC, the trader collected the laptop and gave Sofia a full refund of \u20ac445.92 If you contact the trader or a European Consumer Centre, as described above, you still have the right to bring a case before a court at a later stage.

If your dispute relates to a product or service you bought online, you can also submit your complaint online via the online dispute resolution (ODR) website. Alternative dispute resolution is usually a low-cost and simple procedure that can stop you having to take your case to court. Alternative Dispute Resolution Alternative dispute resolution procedures are provided by neutral out-of-court bodies such as conciliators, mediators, arbitrators, the ombudsman and complaints boards. They can bring you and the trader together to help find a solution to your dispute. They can also propose a solution or even impose one. Alternative dispute resolution bodies have to meet strict EU quality criteria, which guarantee that they handle your dispute in an effective, fair, independent and transparent way. Most of them can help you free of charge or at a low cost. They usually reach an outcome within 90 days. Under EU law, you can use these bodies to handle all contractual disputes you may have with a trader established in the EU. Alternative dispute resolution can be used for any market sector (such as transport, banking, telecoms, energy, electronic goods, household appliances, car rental or dry cleaning). Find a dispute resolution body in your country. Sample story Dispute resolution bodies can help you Arvidas from Lithuania received a bill from his internet provider that was higher than stated in his contract. Having tried in vain to sort out the problem with the trader, Arvidas turned to the relevant alternative dispute resolution body in Lithuania, where he was able to find a solution at a minimum of inconvenience to him. Online Dispute Resolution If you have a dispute with a trader in an EU country over goods or services you bought online, you can use the EU online dispute resolution site. This website is available in all EU languages and is free of charge. If you submit a complaint through the EU online dispute resolution site, you and the trader will need to agree on the alternative dispute resolution body that will handle your dispute. Each body has its own rules and procedures, possibly including fees. But don't worry, you can get help and information from your national contact point at any stage of the procedure. Sample story Try fixing your complaint using online dispute resolution Michaela from Czechia bought a new smartphone online from a trader in Germany. The phone did not correspond to what she had ordered and she couldn't reach a solution with the trader so she submitted her complaint through the EU online dispute resolution site. With Michaela and the trader's agreement, the appropriate alternative dispute resolution body handled the case, which resulted in Michaela receiving a new smartphone. The solution was found in an easy and low-cost way and the procedure was done entirely online.

The connection is provided by the network operator designated to operate the energy infrastructure in your local area (each local network has only one designated operator). To find out exactly what the terms, conditions and tariffs for such connections are, check with your National Regulatory Authority. This body also has to monitor that the local network operators ensure that the local infrastructures function properly. Sample story You have the right to an electricity connection Marian moved to a remote part of the Romanian countryside and wanted to get an electricity connection for his new house there. After several companies had told him their networks didn't cover his area, he finally found out through the National Regulatory Authority who the service provider was in Romania. He contacted this company, which connected him to the electricity network. Vulnerable consumers If you are in a vulnerable situation (for example, if you don't have adequate infrastructure or you can't pay your energy bills) you cannot be disconnected from the electricity network, and you may be entitled to benefits to ensure you get the necessary electricity supply. The Single Point of Contact in the country where you live will explain to you when and/or if you are entitled to such support and what measures have been taken to help you. Choice of energy supplier In the EU you are free to choose your energy supplier from the full range of electricity or gas suppliers offering their services in your area. You can choose an electricity or gas supplier registered in another EU country, provided that the supplier also offers services in your area and agrees a contract with you. Warning There is a distinct difference between an energy supplier and a network operator. You can choose the supplier but not the network operator in your area. The network operator cannot itself offer energy supplies. Sometimes the network operator is part of a larger company which does offer energy supplies. However in such a case, the network operator must have a separate visual identity in order not to create confusion with the separate company offering the supplies. Switching energy supplier If you decide to change your gas or electricity supplier you will not be charged for the change. The network operator in your area must make the change within 3 weeks, provided you respect the terms and conditions of the original contract (e.g. notice period, agreed minimum duration of the contract). Suppliers are not allowed to impose disproportionate obligations that would prevent consumers from switching. No later than 6 weeks after you switch, you should receive the final closure statement/bill from your previous supplier.

Your energy supplier has to provide you with information on how to do this. This should enable you to settle your dispute promptly and get reimbursement and/or compensation if relevant. If you're not satisfied with how your complaint is managed , you also have the right to send your complaint to an independent body for out-of-court dispute settlement such as an energy ombudsman. These options do not limit your right to subsequently bring a case before a court. Sample story An ombudsman can help with your complaint Helen from France was not happy with her electricity bill. She couldn't understand how the company had calculated the total amount to be paid and it seemed excessive. She complained in writing to her electricity provider but the reply she got was not satisfactory. 8 weeks after making the complaint, which was not solved by the company, Helen decided to report her case to the Energy Ombudsman. The Ombudsman asked the company to explain what happened and requested they correct the problem. The company admitted that it had made a mistake when calculating Helen's bill. They also changed their standard bill format, to make the information easier for consumers to understand. National contact points for energy Within your country, you must have access to a single point of contact from where you can get all the information you need about your energy rights, current legislation and how to deal effectively with any gas or electricity supplier dispute. National regulatory authorities Your rights as an energy consumer in the EU have to be set out in the national laws of your country. For more information contact your national regulatory authority which must ensure that consumers are protected in line with EU law.

You must also be given advance notice if any changes are made to the contract, and be able to end the contract if you don't accept the new conditions. Right of withdrawal You have the right to withdraw from a new contract within 14 days if the contract was concluded outside the supplier's business premises or by internet or telephone. Accurate information on your energy consumption You are entitled to have acces to your consumption data for free. You can ask the data manager (e.g. energy supplier or network operator) to give this data to other electricity or gas suppliers and you can't be charged for this service. You have the right to have a competitively-priced accurate individual meter for electricity and gas (as well as district heating/cooling and hot water) when a new connection is installed in a building (for example, when a building undergoes major renovation). In other cases, your right to have a competitively priced accurate individual meter applies unless technical or financial obstacles have been identified at national level. If you have a smart meter, you should be able to access easily and free-of-charge detailed information on your own energy consumption under your current supply contract covering at least the 2 previous years. You also have the right to access data on your consumption covering at least the 3 previous years or since the start of your current supply contract if that's more recent. Warning Your gas and electricity bills should be based on actual energy used and must be sent to you frequently enough to enable you to manage how much energy you use. The bills should be clear and contain useful information. They should allow you to: easily understand how much you 're really paying for the energy that you've used, and compare offers from different energy suppliers so that you can change supplier if you want to. How to use energy efficiently You have a right to be properly informed about how much energy you use and how to use energy more efficiently. Your energy bi\u00a0lls, contracts, transactions and receipts should - unless your national authorities deem it not appropriate - set out clearly: the actual prices and how much energy you have used a comparison with how much energy you used during the same period in the previous year who you can contact to find out how to save energy, for example consumer organisations, energy agencies or similar bodies, including website addresses and,\u00a0if possible, comparisons with similar types of customers EU energy label When you buy a new fridge, freezer, washing machine, tumble dryer, dishwasher, electric oven, TV, lamp or air conditioner, you should be informed about how much energy these appliances use. Shops have to display the EU energy label as well as a product data sheet with detailed information on the performance of the product. Energy performance certificate You are entitled to information on the energy performance of a property when looking to buy or rent. Before you sign a contract you should receive an energy performance certificate, explaining how the property rates in terms of energy efficiency. This certificate should also recommend ways to improve the property's energy efficiency. Renewable energy sources Either the equipment supplier or the national authorities should inform you about the benefits, costs and energy efficiency of equipment and systems for the use of heating, cooling and electricity from renewable energy sources. Your electricity supplier must aprovide you with information on the mix of its energy sources (renewables, nuclear, etc.) and the environmental impact. This information must be presented in an easy and comparable manner. If you're thinking about installing or changing a system producing electricity or heating/cooling from renewable energy sources, you should receive information from the equipment supplier or designated national authority on the costs/benefits and energy efficiency of such equipment.

If you are legally resident in an EU country you are entitled to open a \"basic payment account\". Banks cannot refuse your application for a basic payment account just because you don't live in the country where the bank is established. Warning This right does not apply to other types of bank account, such as savings accounts. When banks can refuse you a basic payment account You can be refused an account if you do not comply with EU rules on money laundering and terrorist financing. In some EU countries, you may be refused a basic bank account if you already have a similar account with another bank in the same country. If you're applying for a basic payment account outside the country where you live, banks in some EU countries may also want you to prove a genuine interest for doing so \u2013 for example if you live in one country but work in another. Features of a basic account A \"basic payment account\" is an account that covers standard transactions that you use in daily life, such as: making deposits withdrawing cash receiving and carrying out payments (for example direct debits and card purchases) It should also include a payment card that you can use to withdraw cash and make purchases - both online and in shops. Where available, the bank should include access to online banking services with your account. However, they do not always have to include an overdraft or credit facility. In some EU countries, your bank might still charge you an annual fee for this basic payment account. This fee should remain reasonable. Sample story You don't need to live in an EU country to have an account there S\u00e1ndor started to work for a company based in Slovenia while continuing to live in Hungary. He decided he would like a bank account in Slovenia to use for day-to-day expenses, in addition to his Hungarian bank account. He found a Slovenian bank near his work and asked to open a basic account. The bank let him open an account even though he was not living in Slovenia. Banks cannot simply refuse you a basic account because you don't live in the country. Fee information Before you open your account, the bank should give you a document showing the most important services offered on the account and any related fees that you might have to pay. This is known as a \"fee information document\". You can use it to compare the cost of accounts at different banks. Your bank must also give you a statement explaining the fees incurred on your bank account at least once a year. This \"statement of fees\" document should also give information on the interest rates applied to your account. Switching bank accounts You can switch your bank account to another bank account in the same EU country. Your new bank should help you with this. If you want to switch to a new account in the same country, tell your new bank that you want to switch and transfer your recurring payments to the new account. The new bank will then ensure that your old bank transfers data and cancels any standing orders. The new bank must also: inform third parties \u2013 such as your employer, social security provider and utilities providers \u2013 that you are changing your account set up your new standing orders accept relevant direct debits on the new account You may still be charged a fee if you decide to close your old account. If you incur costs during the switching procedure because the bank misses a deadline (to cancel a payment for example) or makes mistakes, they have to refund these costs. If you have any difficulties, you can take the issue to the out-of-court dispute resolution scheme. Sample story Switching bank accounts doesn't always go smoothly When Suzanne moved from Toulouse to Paris, she decided to move her bank account to her local bank in Paris. She asked her new bank in Paris to transfer all her payments to the new account and close her old account in Toulouse. The bank in Paris told the bank in Toulouse to cancel her standing orders and close Suzanne's account. They then set up standing orders from her new account. However, they forgot to tell her mobile phone provider, and Suzanne was fined when the standing order for her mobile phone contract didn't go through on time. Suzanne complained to the bank in Paris. They agreed to refund her the cost of the fine and correct the standing order payment for the mobile phone contract. Your money protected in the EU EU rules ensure that the money in your bank account (savings account and/or and current account) is protected if the bank holding your account fails. Your money is protected up to a limit of EUR 100 000 or the equivalent in local currency. This limit applies per person and per bank, meaning that if you have several accounts at the same bank, the limit of EUR 100 000 applies to your aggregated accounts. There are some exceptions to this rule. If you have a joint account with your partner, for example, the limit of EUR 100 000 applies to each of you, meaning up to a maximum of EUR 200 000 for your joint account. In addition, your money will also be protected above EUR 100 000 in certain other cases for a limited time, such as: money you receive from selling a private residential property money you receive linked to a particular event in your life such as marriage, divorce, retirement, dismissal, redundancy, invalidity or death of a family member money you receive from the payment of insurance benefits or compensation for criminal injuries or a wrongful conviction In these cases, amounts over EUR 100 000 are protected for at least three months and no more than 12 months after the money has been credited, or from the moment when the money became legally transferable, depending on the conditions and thresholds set by each EU country.

Key information so you can compare offers If you decide to buy a new product on credit, it's best to compare offers before taking any decisions. Before you sign any credit contract, the credit provider has to give you a standard document called the Standard European Consumer Credit Information form. This is designed to give you the best possible overview of the terms and conditions of any credit contract you consider. It includes: the main features of the contract the amount of credit and its cost the Annual Percentage Rate (APR - a single figure representing the total cost of the credit, including interest, commission, taxes and any other kinds of fees) the number, frequency and size of all your payments a note on important legal aspects This allows you to compare offers from different credit providers and select the one that suits you best. If you haven't received this form from your credit provider, you can request it. Withdrawing from a credit contract If you're having second thoughts about the credit agreement you've signed or realise that you don't need credit after all, you can withdraw from the agreement within 14 calendar days of signing it. You don't have to give the credit provider any explanation, but you'll have to refund the money you borrowed, plus interest and any non-refundable charges already paid by the credit provider. Sample story Paolo, from Italy, took out a EUR 1 000 loan from a non-bank lender to buy a new washing machine. Before signing the contract, he was given very little information about the credit, and he didn't receive the standard pre-contract information sheet (the Standard European Consumer Credit Information form). He was told he was to repay the loan within 2 years, at a moderate rate of interest. After signing the contract, he realised that the Annual Percentage Rate of charge (the total cost of the credit) would be very high. He then decided not to take out this loan after all, but to find a better alternative. On contacting the local consumer organisation, he learned that he could withdraw from the contract within 14 days simply by writing a letter to the creditor and repaying the money he had already received. Paying off your loan early If you want to pay off your credit earlier than stated in your contract, you have the right to do so. Be aware that you may have to compensate the credit provider for the income they have forfeited. This compensatory payment, however, must not exceed the total amount of interest actually forgone. These rules apply to consumer credit between EUR 200 and EUR 75 000, with the exception of loans: secured by a mortgage concluded for the purchase of land or real estate for lease or rental agreements where there is no obligation to purchase granted free of interest, without other charges, or in the form of an overdraft facility to be repaid within 1 month resulting from a judicial ruling linked to loans granted to a restricted group from within the general public Taking out a credit or a loan in another EU country If you want to take out a credit or a loan in another EU country, be aware that banks may be reluctant to lend to residents of countries other than the one the bank is based in or even to lend to residents of the same country working in another EU country. Banks are free to set these kinds of limits to their lending. But if you think a bank has discriminated against you, you may wish to: contact the bank (its complaints office) to obtain a written reply stating the exact reasons for refusing you credit based on the written answer from the bank, ask for advice and help from FIN-NET (the Financial Dispute Resolution Network), which mediates in financial conflicts between consumers and providers of financial services, such as banks EU legislation Consumer Credit Directive Directive on additional assumptions for the calculation of the annual percentage rate of charge Affected by Brexit?

You can therefore shop around the European market for the best deals on insurance products (for example, life insurance, household insurance, and car insurance). Warning This only concerns private insurance and occupational pension funds and not your social security and statutory pension rights relating to your work history. Insurance products may be sold either by insurance companies directly (often through websites), through insurance intermediaries (brokers, agents) or by businesses such as airlines, travel agencies, opticians or sellers of electronic appliances. Sellers of insurance products have to give you certain essential information about themselves and the insurance product before you sign a contract. Key information so you can understand what you're buying Before you sign up for an insurance product, you should receive a standardised information document, known as an \"Insurance Product Information Document\". This document will help you understand what you are buying and allow you to compare offers for similar insurance products from other insurers. Warning These rules do not apply to life insurance products. The document you receive should be short (no more than 2 sides of A4), clearly written and explain the following: the name of the insurance product and the insurance company providing it the type of insurance what is insured what is not insured any restrictions in terms of cover your obligations when and how you have to pay when the cover starts and ends how you can cancel the contract Before you sign a contract the person or company selling the insurance product must also tell you whether they're acting as an agent or broker and about their links to the insurance company providing the product. For example, they have to tell you whether they receive commission from the insurance company to sell their products. Buying goods or services together with an insurance product When you are offered a non-life insurance product together with another product or service \u2013 such as car insurance with your new car, or accidental damage insurance with your new laptop \u2013 you always have the right to buy the product or service without the insurance policy. Sample story You can't be obliged to take out insurance with the trader you make your purchase with Carole, from France, recently broke her glasses, so went to get a new pair at her local optician. After choosing her new glasses, the optician suggested she take out accidental damage cover in case she broke them again. He explained the cover and costs and gave her a brochure with the information, so she could think about it at home while waiting for her glasses to be made. At home, Carole checked similar insurance policies with other companies online and found one that offered the same cover for a cheaper price. When she collected her new glasses a week later, she opted not to take the insurance policy offered by the optician. Instead she signed up for the cheaper policy she had found online.

Unlike a standard savings account, the value of investments and the income from investment products can decrease as well as increase. As the way investment products work can be quite complex, it's not always easy to understand the returns you may gain as well as the potential risks you face. EU rules guarantee that you receive detailed information before you sign up for an investment product, so you're fully aware of the scale or nature of the risks you're taking on. Warning These EU rules do not cover occupational pension schemes, direct investments (such as shares), investment products for professional investors, and life insurance products with no investment options to retail investors where the benefits are only paid on death or incapacity. Key information explaining the investment Before you take out an investment product, the person or organisation selling it must give you a Key Information Document. This standard document is designed to give clear answers to your questions about the features, risks and costs of the investment product you're interested in. The information document you're given must be no more than 3 A4 pages long, and must contain the following information: general information on the provider and their contact details a description of the investment product, what it aims to do and how an explanation of the main factors that the return depends upon information about the term of the investment product, its maturity date, and the conditions for terminating your investment the level of risk of the investment product (classed from 1 to 7) an indication of the possible maximum loss from your investment, plus 4 appropriate performance scenarios \u2013 stress scenario, unfavourable scenario, moderate scenario and favourable scenario a table explaining the costs of your investment over time, in monetary and percentage terms a table giving information on one-off costs (such as entry and exit costs), recurring costs (such as portfolio transaction costs per year) and incidental costs, such as performance fees \u2013 all expressed in percentage terms how to make a complaint, including a link to the relevant complaints website, and a postal address and email address for submitting complaints Time to compare and choose The key information document allows you to easily compare investment products from different providers and choose the one that best suits your needs. You must therefore receive the information document early enough for you to have enough time to consider your options before you are bound by a contract or offer. Even if there's a cooling off period the person selling you the investment product must give you the information document before you sign a contract. Sample story The information document can help you choose the right investment product Leonard wanted to save some money for his retirement. He spoke to his bank about different account options. The bank suggested that he put aside EUR 150 each month in a special life insurance savings plan. They explained that this kind of investment product gave Leonard the possibility to get a better return on his money than with a normal savings account. Leonard asked for more information on the plan, and was given the Key Information Document. When he read the document, Leonard saw from the different performance scenarios that he risked losing some of his retirement savings if the investments linked to the savings plan didn't perform well. He spoke to the bank and decided instead to choose a standard savings account.

Mortgages are offered by banks, building societies or other lenders and are often secured against your property. A mortgage loan usually comes with a lower interest rate and a longer redemption period in comparison with consumer credit. However, if you fail to fulfil your repayment obligations and your mortgage has been secured against your property, lenders can seize and resell your home to pay off the loan. Banks are free to accept or not your mortgage application. Before offering you a mortgage, the lender needs to assess your creditworthiness, that is whether you can actually afford it. You can in principle also obtain a mortgage loan from lenders based in other EU countries; however, your country of residence, where you work or the location of the property may influence how the lender assesses your application. Understanding how your creditworthiness is assessed is therefore crucial. Creditworthiness assessment Before agreeing to offer you a loan, lenders must assess your creditworthiness. They will make their assessment on the basis of different criteria, including: your financial situation (assets, debts, etc.) the value of the property the loan is secured against You will therefore be asked to disclose your income so that the lender can check whether you are capable to repay the loan. The lender can only offer you a mortgage credit if the assessment shows you are likely to be able to repay the loan. Lenders frequently refuse to grant mortgages for properties located in other countries, or to people whose source of income or place of residence is not in the country where the bank is located. However, they are not allowed to discriminate between EU citizens solely on the basis of nationality. If you think a bank has discriminated against you on the basis of your nationality, you may wish to: contact the bank (its 'complaints office') to obtain an official statement in writing giving the reasons for their refusal if the refusal is solely based on your nationality, ask for advice and help from FIN-NET (the Financial Dispute Resolution Network), which mediates in cross-border conflicts between consumers and financial service providers, such as banks Key information to assess and compare offers It is advisable to compare offers from different lenders before taking a decision on a mortgage loan. When making a binding offer, the lender has also to give you the European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS). This standard document is designed to give you the best possible overview of the terms and conditions of the mortgage credit on offer. The ESIS provides the following information: the amount of the loan the duration of the loan the type of interest rate the total amount to be reimbursed the annual percentage rate of charge (APRC): a single figure representing the total cost of the loan, expressed as an annual percentage. The APRC is provided to help you compare different offers any costs to be paid, regularly or on a one-off basis the number, frequency and size of your payments information on the conditions for early repayment and charges you would be liable for if you decide to repay your loan early if you are taking out a loan in a foreign currency: examples explaining the potential effects of exchange rate changes on your mortgage credit The ESIS allows you also to compare offers from different credit providers and select the one that suits you best. If you haven't received the ESIS form from your lender, you can request it. At least 7 days to assess offers or withdraw Under EU rules, the lender or credit intermediary has to give you at least 7 days to assess the offer; some EU countries' national law will give you more time. Depending on the country where you are applying for your loan, this could either be: a reflection period, during which you can consider whether the offer suits you a period during which you can withdraw from the credit agreement you have already signed a combination of the two. Paying off your mortgage loan early You can usually repay part or all of your debt early. This allows you to stop paying interest on outstanding debt, or move to a more favourable mortgage offer, including from a different lender. National rules determine in this case whether the lender can ask you to pay compensation if you terminate your mortgage loan earlier than foreseen. Where applicable, such compensation should never exceed the financial loss of the lender. Mortgage credit insurance, other services Mortgage credit insurance comes into play if you are faced with circumstances that prevent you from repaying your debt - for instance, in the case of death, illness or job loss. Lenders can require that you buy a mortgage credit policy. They may propose a policy to you in a package with your mortgage credit agreement; but this cannot be made a condition for you to obtain the mortgage credit. You are always free to look for better conditions from other insurers, as long as the level of guarantee offered by different policies is equivalent to what is required by the lender. Lenders can, however, oblige you to open a payment or savings account with them, from which you will repay the loan. EU legislation Mortgage Credit Directive Affected by Brexit?

This includes any: transfers between bank accounts in different EU countries withdrawals from cash machines/ATMs in EU countries payments by debit or credit card across the EU direct debit transactions Banks based in EU countries outside the euro area must also apply this rule, and may not charge more for a payment in euros to/within another EU country than they do for a domestic payment in the national currency. Sample story Payments in euro cost the same as domestic payments Jakub lives in Czechia and has a Czech bank account. His bank charges him 5K\u010d when he transfers money in Czech koruna to any other Czech bank account. Following a recent holiday, Jakub needs to transfer \u20ac150 to a friend's bank account in France. His bank can only charge him the same rate as they charge him for a bank transfer in Czech koruna within Czechia \u2013 5K\u010d \u2013 or the equivalent in euros. Secure online payments If you want to make an online payment for more than \u20ac30, you will need to use a combination of at least two authentication elements, such as: something you have (such as your mobile phone or card reader) AND something you know (a PIN or \u200ba password) something you have (your mobile phone or card reader) AND something you are (your fingerprint) something you know (a PIN or a \u200bpassword) AND something you are (your fingerprint) This makes your payments safer and more secure. Charges for using your card When you pay for something in the EU using your credit or debit card, traders and banks cannot charge you an extra fee \u2013 also known as \"surcharging\" \u2013 just for using a particular card. This rule applies to all card purchases (in shops and online) made within your home country or in another EU country. Warning Credit and debit cards issued by three party schemes (such as American Express and Diners Club), and business or corporate credit cards, where your employer is billed instead of you, are not covered by EU rules on payment services, and you can still be charged extra for using these cards. You should be aware that if you're paying in EU currencies other than euros, you may still be charged a currency conversion fee by your card provider when you use your card in another country. However, the card provider, your bank, the trader or the website carrying out the transaction must inform you of the amount of any such fees before you agree to the purchase. Your card provider must inform you of such fees in the terms & conditions of your card and on an easily accessible electronic platform, such as a website or app. Sample story You shouldn't be charged extra for using your card Clara from Austria wanted to buy flight tickets online. She selected her tickets on the airline's website and went to pay. However, when she entered her credit card information, the airline added an extra \u20ac10 to the cost of her order as a charge for using a credit card. Clara contacted her local European Consumer Centre, who raised a complaint with the airline. The airline refunded the \u20ac10 charge for her booking, and modified their rules to remove the illegal surcharge from their booking process. Card and payment fraud EU rules limit the amount you can be asked to pay if you're the victim of card or payment fraud \u2013 where your card or your account is debited without your permission. In all cases, you can only be asked to pay a maximum of \u20ac50 towards the cost of the fraudulent payments. However, in cases where you were unaware of the loss, theft or misappropriation of funds (i.e. your account was hacked, or your card was cloned and charged without your knowledge), then you don't have to pay anything. Your bank or card provider should cover all the costs. This rule also applies if the loss was caused by a bank employee. Blocked money on your card Sometimes when you make a reservation, such as a hotel booking or car rental, you may be asked to give your card details to guarantee your booking. The trader may also ask to block a certain amount of money on your card when you make your reservation. This means the trader reserves part of your credit limit or account balance to cover any charge they expect you to build up, such as room service in a hotel, or possible damage to a hire car. You should be informed by the trader if they intend to block an amount on your credit card, and you must give your approval for this and for the exact amount being blocked. As soon as you have made the real payment \u2013 for example, when you check out of your hotel and use your credit card to pay for your room, or when you return your hire car and pay the final bill \u2013 the bank must immediately release the blocked amount from your credit card. Sample story Blocked amounts must be released as soon as you pay Boris from Hungary went to Venice for the weekend with his girlfriend. When they arrived at their hotel, the hotel took Boris' credit card details. The hotel informed Boris that they would like to block \u20ac500 to cover his reservation and any use of the mini-bar and restaurant services during their stay. Boris agreed to have his card blocked with this amount. Before leaving the hotel, Boris paid his hotel bill using his credit card. A week later, when he tried to book some flights with his credit card, Boris realised that \u20ac500 was still blocked on his credit card. He called the hotel to complain, who apologised for their mistake and immediately asked the bank to release the blocked amount. IBAN Discrimination If you wish to use SEPA credit transfers or SEPA direct debits to pay bills, purchase products/services online, pay taxes or receive tax refunds/unemployment benefits or other allowances, your account may not be refused because it is situated in a different Member State than your counterpart. This is applicable only if the counterpart is accepting such transactions from domestic accounts. In case of IBAN discrimination a complaint can be filed with the relevant competent authority in the Member State of your counterpart. Direct debits If you have a direct debit set up from your bank account, it may happen that a payment is made by mistake or the wrong amount is taken \u2013 for example if you cancelled a contract with a supplier, but the direct debit was still made after the contract was terminated. In these situations, you have the right to get a payment refunded within 8 weeks. This applies to all direct debits, both within your home country and cross-border direct debits within the EU. What to do if you have a problem If you have any problems making payments within the EU, you should contact your bank or card provider. They must give a written response to your complaint within 15 days (or up to 35 days in certain exceptional circumstances). They should also have a formal complaints procedure in place for consumers. If you need any help getting your rights recognised, you can contact FIN-NET for problems with financial service providers, or ECC-Net for problems with traders. You may also report cases of IBAN discrimination here. This will enable the European Commission to closely monitor and help solve complaints of IBAN discrimination that have been submitted to the national competent authority. Cheques EU rules on bank charges for international and national payments do not apply to cheques. There are sometimes very high transaction fees for cashing a cheque from another EU country. In many countries, cheques are also no longer accepted as a means of payment.

This means, for example, that if you pay for a subscription to an online TV content provider, when you travel to another EU country you can watch and download the same films and TV series as you would at home. The same rules apply to all your paid subscriptions for online content, such as e-books, games, music and sports events. If you have a contract with an online content provider which limits your access in other EU countries or if you had to pay extra to access content while abroad, these restrictions no longer apply. Accessing free online content abroad EU rules also cover free subscriptions to online content when you travel to another EU country, but on an optional basis. This means that access to your free online content services when you're abroad depends on your service provider. Checking your EU country of residence Your content provider is allowed to use up to 2 of the following ways to check your EU country of residence: your ID card or another electronic means of identification your payment details, such as your bank account or credit/debit card number the address where you have a set-top box, decoder or similar device installed your payment of a licence fee for services such as public service broadcasting, in your EU country of residence an internet or telephone contract, or another similar type of contract, in your EU country of residence your registration on local electoral rolls your payment of local taxes a utility bill from your EU country of residence If needed, your content provider may also use one of the following ways to check your EU country of residence, but only in combination with one of the other methods listed above: your billing address or postal address a self-declaration confirming your address in your EU country of residence your IP address (to check where you accessonline content from) Sample story You\u00a0can access your paid online content while travelling in Europe Sarah, a student in Belgium, paid 10 EUR a month for a subscription to an online music streaming service so she could listen to music on her tablet. When she went on an Erasmus placement to Spain for 3 months, her provider stopped her access, giving the reason that she was no longer living in Belgium. Sarah complained to the provider and they checked her place of residence. They realised that she was still a Belgian resident as her stay abroad was only temporary, and gave her back full access to the music streaming service. Access to the same content wherever you are Your content provider is not allowed to charge you extra for providing access to content you already have a paid subscription for while you're in another EU country. You should also have access under the same conditions as in your home country \u2013 i.e. access to the same content, on the same range and number of devices, for the same number of users and with the same functionalities. Your content provider is also not allowed to deliberately reduce the quality of the content you receive while you're abroad. However, you should keep in mind that the quality of your online content will also depend on the network you use to access your content (such as a Wi-Fi connection or 3G/4G network). Accessing online content using a 3G/4G network while you're in another EU country will be taken as part of your data usage in your mobile phone contract.

These rules apply to both companies and organisations (public and private) in the EU and those based outside the EU who offer goods or services in the EU, such as Facebook or Amazon, whenever these companies request or re-use the personal data of individuals in the EU. It doesn't matter what format the data takes \u2013 online on a computer system or on paper in a structured file \u2013 whenever information directly or indirectly identifying you as an individual is stored or processed, your data protection rights have to be respected. When is data processing allowed? EU data protection rules, also known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (or GDPR), describe different situations where a company or an organisation is allowed to collect or reuse your personal information: they have a contract with you \u2013 for example, a contract to supply goods or services (i.e. when you buy something online), or an employee contract they are complying with a legal obligation \u2013 for example, when processing your data is a legal requirement, for example when your employer gives information on your monthly salary to the social security authority, so that you have social security cover when data processing is in your vital interests \u2013 for example, when this might protect your life to complete a public task \u2013 mostly relating to the tasks of public administrations such as schools, hospitals, and municipalities when there are legitimate interests \u2013 for example, if your bank uses your personal data to check whether you'd be eligible for a savings account with a higher interest rate In all other situations, the company or organisation must ask for your agreement (known as \"consent\") before they can collect or reuse your personal data. Agreeing to data processing \u2013 consent When a company or organisation asks for your consent, you have to make a clear action agreeing to this, for example by signing a consent form or selecting yes from a clear yes/no option on a webpage. It is not enough to simply opt out, for example by checking a box saying you don't want to receive marketing emails. You have to opt in and agree to your personal data being stored and/or re-used for this purpose. You should also be given the following information before you decide to opt in: information about the company/ organisation that will process your data, including their contact details, and the contact details of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) if there is one the reason why the company /organisation will use your personal data how long they intend to keep your personal data details of any other company or organisation that will receive your personal data information on your data protection rights (access, correction, deletion, complaint, withdrawal of consent) All this information should be presented in a clear and understandable way. Withdrawing consent to use personal data and the right to object If you previously gave your consent for a company or organisation to use your personal data, you can contact the data controller (the person or body handling your personal data) and withdraw your permission at any time. Once you've withdrawn your permission, the company or organisation can no longer use your personal data. When an organisation is processing your personal data on the basis of their own legitimate interest or as part of a task in the public interest or for an official authority, you may have the right to object. In some specific cases, public interest may prevail and the company or organisation may be allowed to continue using your personal data. For example, this could be the case for scientific research and statistics, a task performed as part of the official role of a public authority. For direct marketing emails that promote particular brands or products, your prior consent is required. However, if you are an existing customer of a particular company, they can send you direct marketing emails about their own similar products or services. You have the right to object at any time to receiving such direct marketing and the company have to stop using your data immediately. In all cases, you should always be given information about the right to object to the use of your personal data the first time that the company or organisation contacts you. Sample story You can object to your data being used for direct marketing Anatolios bought two tickets online to see his favourite band play in a live concert. Since buying the tickets, Anatolios started receiving emails with adverts for concerts and events that he wasn't interested in. He contacted the online ticketing company and asked them to stop sending him these advertising emails. The company immediately removed him from their direct marketing lists. Anatolios was happy that he didn't get any more advertising emails from them. Specific rules for children If your children want to use online services, such as social media, downloading music or games, they will often need approval from you, as their parent or legal guardian, as these services use the child's personal data. Your child will no longer need parental consent once they're aged over 16 (in some EU countries this age limit might be as low as 13). Controls to check parental consent have to be effective, for example by using a verification message sent to a parent's email address. Access to your personal data You can request access to the personal data a company or organisation has about you, and you have the right to get a copy of your data, free of charge, in an accessible format. They should reply to you within 1 month and have to give you a copy of your personal data and any relevant information about how the data has been used, or is being used. Sample story You have a right to know what data is stored about you and how it's used Maciej, from Poland, recently subscribed to his local supermarket's loyalty scheme. Shortly after joining the scheme, he noticed he started receiving better discount vouchers for his shopping. He wondered if this was related to the loyalty scheme, so he asked the supermarket's data protection officer to tell him which information was being stored about him and how it was being used. Maciej discovered that the supermarket kept data on the products he bought every week and then was able to give him discounts related to the specific products he liked to buy. Correcting your personal data If a company or organisation has stored personal data about you that isn't correct or is missing some information, then you can ask them to correct or update your data. Sample story You have the right to correct incorrect data about yourself Alison wanted to buy a new house in Ireland and applied for a mortgage from her bank. When completing the registration form, she made a mistake entering her date of birth and the bank registered her age incorrectly in their system. When Alison got the offers for her new mortgage and associated life insurance, she realised the mistake, as her insurance premium was much higher than her current one. She contacted the bank and asked them to correct her personal data in their system. She then received a new version of the insurance offer that correctly indicated her date of birth. Transferring your personal data (right to data portability) In certain situations, you can ask a company or organisation to return your data to you or to transfer it directly to another company, if this is technically possible. This is known as \"data portability\". For example, you can use this right if you decide to switch from one service to another similar service \u2013 for example moving from one social media site to a new one \u2013 and you'd like your personal information to be quickly and easily transferred to the new service. Deleting your personal data (the right to be forgotten) If your personal data is no longer needed or is being used unlawfully then you can ask for your data to be erased. This is known as \"the right to be forgotten\". These rules also apply to search engines, such as Google, as they're also considered to be data controllers. You can ask for links to web pages including your name to be removed from search engine results, if the information is inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive. If a company has made your personal data available online and you ask for them to be deleted, the company also has to inform any other websites where they've been shared that you've asked for your data and links to them to be deleted. To protect other rights, such as freedom of expression, some data may not be automatically deleted. For example, controversial statements made by people in the public eye, might not be deleted if public interest is best served by keeping them online. Sample story You can ask for your personal data to be deleted and removed from other websites Alfredo decided he no longer wanted to use any social media, so he deleted his profile from the social media sites he was using. However, a few weeks later he found his old profile photos from his social media accounts were still visible when he looked up his name in an internet search engine. Alfredo contacted the social media companies and asked them to ensure that these photos were removed. When he searched a month later, the photos had indeed been removed and they no longer appeared in the search engine results. Unauthorised access to your data (data breach) If your personal information is stolen, lost or illegally accessed \u2013 known as a 'personal data breach' \u2013 the data controller (the person or body handling your personal data) must report it to the national data protection authority. The data controller must also inform you directly if there are serious risks related to your personal data or privacy due to the breach. Making a complaint If you think your data protection rights have not been respected, you can make a complaint directly to your national data protection authority which will investigate your complaint and give you a response within 3 months. You can also chose to file a case directly in court against the company or organisation concerned instead of first going to your national data protection authority. You may be entitled to compensation if you suffer material damage, such as financial loss, or non-material damage, such as psychological distress, due to a company or organisation not respecting EU data protection rules.

including basic internet access. This is known as the \"universal service\" provision. There should be at least one internet provider who can provide this service for you. Warning In some specific cases, such as issues with the technical feasibility of a request, your request might not be considered \"reasonable\" and could be refused. To find out more, contact the national regulatory authorities in your country. They will put you in touch with your universal service provider. Open internet EU rules on open internet give you the right as a user to access and/or distribute any online content and services you choose. Your internet provider cannot block, slow down or discriminate against any online content, applications or services, except in 3 specific cases: to comply with legal obligations, such as a court order blocking specific illegal content to preserve the security and integrity of the network, for example to combat viruses or malware to manage exceptional or temporary network congestion Sample story You can access the online content you want John, from Ireland, recently started a new job in Germany. He wanted to use a video call app to talk to his family so he could save the cost of phone calls. He was pleased to discover that he had a choice of different video call apps he could use for free over his internet connection. EU rules prohibit internet access providers from blocking applications or asking for extra money to use video call apps. Contracts with internet providers Before you sign a contract for internet services, your internet provider must give you information on: prices, rates and charges, including options and packages standard terms and conditions quality of service (for example, download speeds). After you sign a contract, your internet provider must also: notify you well in advance if they want to change the contract (for example, raise their rates) allow you to withdraw from the contract without penalty if you don't accept any of the new conditions offer reasonable minimum contract periods \u2013 a contract for an initial period equal to or shorter than 12 months; contracts that exceed 2 years are illegal Sample story Lengthy contracts are illegal Enrique wanted to get an internet connection in his flat during his 1 year stay in Berlin on a university exchange - but was told by several providers that the minimum subscription time was 2 years. After consulting the national authority for electronic communications and finding out about his rights, Enrique contacted the providers again and was able to get a subscription for 1 year only. Extra support for users with disabilities If you are a user with disabilities, you are entitled to the same range and choice of services enjoyed by other consumers. You may also be eligible for special accessibility devices from your service provider - such as magnification software or a screen reader, if you are visually impaired. Your national regulatory authorities should be able to provide you with more details about these accessibility rights. Sample story Services should be available for users with disabilities V\u00e9ronique, from France, has limited vision and has trouble reading websites. On advice from a friend, she contacted the French universal service provider to enquire about solutions that would help her. The provider delivered a screen reader that enables V\u00e9ronique to read and access information online. Making government websites accessible for all users Public sector/government websites in EU countries have to respect strict web accessibility standards. Accessible websites give all users equal access to a website's information and functionalities. Content should also be compatible with all browsers, devices, software and assistive technologies such as screen readers. Warning EU accessibility rules don't apply to websites and mobile apps owned by public service broadcasters and live audiovisual material. In some EU countries, the rules also don't apply to schools, kindergartens and nurseries. EU accessibility standards In practice, the EU public sector websites you visit should respect certain accessibility requirements, including: having a clear accessibility statement using alternative text for non-text content, such as photos and videos using subtitles on pre-recorded audiovisual content ensuring their content is correctly structured and uses clearly indicated elements (for example, headings and links) - this makes it easier if you need to use an assistive technology such as a screen reader using descriptive and easily understandable links, headings and labels ensuring that you can navigate on the page using only your keyboard allowing you to review and correct forms before you send them clearly marking and explaining any errors you made while filling in a form Some public sector/government websites you use are already applying these standards, and all public sector websites have to meet them by 23 September 2020. Public sector mobile apps have until 23 June 2021 to meet EU accessibility standards. More information on international web accessibility standards is available from W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium).

This is known as \"roaming\" or \"roam like at home\". Your calls (to mobile and fixed phones), text messages (SMS) and data services are charged at domestic rates, i.e. the same price as calls, texts and data within your home country. The same rule also applies to any calls or text messages your receive while you're abroad - you aren't charged extra to receive calls or texts while roaming, even if the person calling you is using a different service provider. Sample story No extra charge for making or receiving calls while roaming Michael lives in Ireland and has a contract with an Irish mobile operator where he pays \u20ac0.10 a minute for calls and \u20ac0.05 for SMS within Ireland. When he goes on a business trip to Spain, Michael doesn't have to worry about paying extra for any calls to EU numbers he makes or receives. Callers from Ireland will be charged the normal domestic rate when they call Michael. If he calls a local Spanish number, his family in Ireland or any other EU country, he will pay Irish domestic prices - \u20ac0.10 a minute - for these calls. His text messages within Spain, to Ireland or to any other EU country will cost \u20ac0.05 - just like at home. What is roaming? Roaming is when you use your mobile phone while occasionally travelling outside the country where you live or have stable links i.e. you work or study there. So, as long as you spend more time at home than abroad, or you use your mobile phone more at home than abroad, you are considered to be roaming. You will therefore be charged domestic prices for your calls, text and data use in the EU. This is considered a \"fair use of roaming services\". Whenever you cross a border within the EU, you should get a text message from your mobile operator informing you that you are roaming, and reminding you of its fair use policy. Warning If you use your mobile phone abroad permanently, for example if you move abroad and keep using your sim card from your home country, your mobile operator may charge you extra for roaming. However, these charges are capped under the fair use policy. Fair use policy - Is my data use limited? Mobile operators may apply a \"fair use policy\" to ensure that all roaming customers have access to and benefit from the \"roam like at home\" rules (i.e. roaming services at domestic prices) when travelling in the EU. This means that your mobile operator may apply fair, reasonable and proportionate control mechanisms to avoid customers abusing the rules. When you're roaming, there are no volume restrictions on your voice calls and text messages (SMS). Any calls or texts not included in your contract will be charged at the same rate you'd pay in your home country. However, there are rules and limits on how much data you can have charged at your domestic price. These limits depend on the type of contract you have. In some specific cases (see below), you may have to pay a data roaming surcharge which will be equal to the EU-wide wholesale data cap (\u20ac3 / GB of data in 2021 + VAT). I have a pre-paid card If you have a pre-paid card (meaning that you pay in advance for using your mobile phone) you can use your phone in other EU countries without paying extra. However, if you pay per unit and your domestic unit price for data is less than \u20ac3 per GB your mobile operator may apply a data limit while you're roaming. If your mobile operator applies a data volume limit, it should be at least the volume obtained by dividing the remaining credit on your pre-paid card by \u20ac3 as soon you start using data roaming services. You will get the same volume of roaming data that you've paid for in advance. You can of course top up your credit while you're travelling. Sample story Roaming with a pre-paid card: data limits Jana lives in Slovakia and has a pre-paid card with \u20ac15 credit (including VAT) for her mobile phone, which covers calls, SMS and data services. When she goes on holiday to Spain, she has \u20ac12 (excluding VAT) credit left on her card. This means that during her holiday in Spain Jana can have a volume of data equal to the value of the remaining credit on her pre-paid card. She will get at least 4 GB of roaming data (\u20ac12/\u20ac3 = 4). My contract includes limited data If you have a mobile phone contract with a limited data allowance, you can use this allowance when you travel in the EU at no extra cost. The data allowance in your contract is your limit when roaming. However, if you have a very cheap mobile data unit price in your contract (less than \u20ac1.50 / GB in 2021), your operator may apply a \"fair use\" data limit when you're roaming. This limit can be lower than your domestic data allowance. The limit is based on the price of your domestic mobile contract. Your operator must tell you in advance about this limit and has to let you know when you reach it. You can continue data roaming once you've reached your limit, but your operator will charge you extra. However, this surcharge will be limited to the wholesale data cap (\u20ac3 / GB + VAT in 2021). My contract includes unlimited data If you have a mobile phone contract where you pay a fixed monthly fee and it includes bundled services with unlimited data, your mobile operator must give you with a large volume of roaming data. The exact amount will depend on how much you pay for your mobile contract. However, the volume of data must be at least twice the amount obtained by dividing the price of your mobile contract (excluding VAT) by the wholesale data roaming cap (\u20ac3 in 2021). Your operator must tell you how much data is in your roaming allowance. If you go over your allowance while roaming, you will be charged extra. However, this surcharge will be limited to the wholesale data cap (\u20ac3 / GB + VAT in 2021). Sample story Contract with unlimited data - roaming allowance Paulina in Luxembourg pays \u20ac40 (excluding VAT) for her mobile phone contract, which includes unlimited calls, text messages (SMS) and data. When she uses her mobile phone on holiday in Italy, she gets unlimited calls and SMS and at least 26.6 GB of data (2 x (\u20ac40 / \u20ac3) = 26.6). Other contracts Operators may also offer contracts without roaming services or specifically designed alternative roaming contracts with tariffs which fall outside the scope of EU rules, for example if you roam outside the EU. However, you must specifically choose these types of options yourself. Monitoring roaming use As part of their fair use policy, your operator can monitor and check your roaming use over a 4 month period. If, during this period, you have spent more time abroad than at home AND your roaming use exceeds your domestic use, your operator may contact you and ask you to clarify your situation. You will have 14 days to do so. If you continue to spend more time abroad than you do at home and your roaming consumption continues to exceed your domestic usage your operator may start charging you extra for your roaming use. The surcharges (excluding VAT) are capped at: \u20ac0.032 per minute of voice calls made \u20ac0.01 per SMS \u20ac3 per GB of data (cap in 2021) Roaming for cross border workers If you work in one EU country and live in a different one,you can choose a mobile operator in either country and roam using a SIM card either from the country where you live or from the country where you work. The fair use policy applies: as long as you connect at least once a day to your domestic operator's network, it will count as a day of presence in the country where you have your contract (even if you go abroad again the same day). Can I roam while travelling by ship or plane? You should also not be charged extra to use your mobile phone when you travel by ship or plane, as long as you are connected to a terrestrial (land-based) mobile network. If mobile services are provided via satellite systems, EU rules no longer apply and you will be charged for non-regulated roaming services (no price caps). Roaming outside the EU The cost of roaming (particularly data roaming) outside the EU can be expensive. To avoid running up steep bills, check the cost for roaming outside the EU with your provider before travelling. If things go wrong - your consumer rights If you think your service provider has not respected your rights, you should contact your operator and use the complaint procedure in place. If you are not satisfied with their response you can contact the relevant national regulatory authorities in your country, usually your national telecoms regulator, who will handle your case.

There should be at least one telecoms provider who can provide this service for you. This is known as the \"universal service\" provision. Warning In some specific cases, such as issues with the technical feasibility of a request, your request might not be considered \"reasonable\" and could be refused. Your national regulatory authority can put you in touch with the universal service provider in your country. Sample story Eleni, from Greece, recently moved from Athens to the countryside and wanted to get a telephone connection in her new house. After trying several companies, who told her that they didn't have a network in her area, she contacted the Greek national regulatory authority. They told her who the universal service provider was, and she was able to get her telephone connection. Contracts with telecoms providers Your telecoms provider must: give you a written contract, with information on rates and charges specify the minimum service quality levels give you detailed information on the duration of the contract and the conditions for its renewal After signing a contract with a telecoms provider, you have the right to: end your contract if the provider changes the terms and conditions of the original contract change telecoms provider (mobile or fixed line) without changing your phone number within one working day You should always be able to call the toll free EU wide emergency number 112 \u2013 from any telephone. This includes calls from public payphones and mobile phones. Sample story Maxime from Belgium received a letter from his mobile telecoms provider with his monthly telephone bill. The letter stated that they were reducing the number of free SMSs in his package. The provider offered him a different, more expensive, package which included unlimited SMSs. Maxime contacted his telecoms operator and cancelled his contract. He decided to take out a contract with a different provider and was able to keep his mobile number when he made the switch. Remember that you have the right to end your contract if your provider changes the terms of your original contract. If you switch to another provider you also have the right to keep your telephone number. Assistance for disabled users If you're a disabled user, you should have access to the same telecommunications services as the majority of consumers. You may also be eligible for special tools or services from your service provider that enable you to use telephone networks \u2013 for example access to live text-to-speech translation services, or the possibility to receive your telephone bill in an alternative format, such as braille. Your national regulatory authority should be able to give you more information about these rights. Calling another EU country from home EU rules limit the amount you can be charged when you call or send an SMS to another EU country from home. You can only be charged a maximum of \u20ac0.19 (+ VAT) a minute for calls to another EU country, and a maximum of \u20ac0.06 (+ VAT) per SMS sent to another country. These maximum call charges apply to calls you make from either your landline or your mobile phone in your home country, to a landline or mobile phone in another EU country. Using your mobile phone abroad - roaming When you use your mobile phone while travelling outside your home country in another EU country you don't have to pay any additional roaming charges. This means that when you call (mobile and fixed phones) or send a text messages (SMS): within the country you're visiting to your home country to another EU country you'll pay the same as you would for a call or SMS within your home country. For data services, you pay the same rates as you would in your home country. Find out more about mobile roaming.

This contract information should include: the main product characteristics the total price inclusive of taxes and all charges delivery costs, (if applicable) - and any other additional charges arrangements for payment, delivery or performance the trader's identity, address and telephone number the duration of the contract (if applicable) Some of this information may not have to be provided explicitly, if it is clear from the context - such as the characteristics of a product which is displayed on a shelf in the shop. If you buy online, by telephone, by mail order catalogue or from a door-to-door salesperson, the following more detailed information must also be provided before you buy anything: e-mail address of the trader any delivery restrictions in certain countries the right to cancel your order within 14 days available after-sales services dispute resolution mechanisms trade register number of the trader professional title and VAT details of the trader (if applicable) professional association to which the trader belongs (if applicable) For these purchases, you should bear in mind that you do not have to pay any delivery costs or other charges which you weren't informed about in advance.

Warning In some EU countries, the right to receive confirmation for your order, to cancel it and other legal requirements do not apply to door-to-door purchases of less than EUR 50. Purchase confirmation When you have purchased something elsewhere than an actual shop \u2013 for example, online, by phone or by catalogue \u2013 you must receive written confirmation of your transaction. The confirmation must be on paper or in a durable format such as e-mail or a message to your personal account on the trader's website \u2013 provided it is something you can store and which the trader cannot unilaterally change. Digital content Specific information requirements apply when you buy digital content online, for example when you download or stream music or video. Before you make your purchase, you must also be informed how the content operates with relevant hardware/software (interoperability) and about its functionalities, including whether any geographical restrictions apply to the use of the content and if private copies are allowed. After-sales communication by telephone Traders who provide after-sales telephone lines for consumers must make sure that calls are charged at the basic rate. It is forbidden for traders to require consumers to use premium-rate telephone lines to make enquiries or complaints about their purchase or contract. Buying from non-EU online traders Your consumer rights under EU rules normally also apply to purchases from non-EU online traders targeting consumers in the EU.

If you bought a product or a service online or outside of a shop (by telephone, mail order, from a door-to-door salesperson), you also have the right to cancel and return your order within 14 days, for any reason and without a justification. If you're not sure which situation applies to you, you can also try our consumer rights tool to help you understand your rights when you shop in the EU. More information about: Guarantees for faulty goods Free of charge, 2-year guarantee for all goods You always have the right to a minimum 2-year guarantee at no cost, regardless of whether you bought your goods online, in a shop or by mail order. This 2-year guarantee is your minimum right, however national rules in your country may give you extra protection. If goods you bought anywhere in the EU turn out to be faulty or do not look or work as advertised, the seller must repair or replace them free of charge or give you a price reduction or a full refund. You can usually only ask for a partial or full refund when it is not possible to repair or replace the goods. Warning You might not be entitled to a refund if the problem is minor, such as a scratch on a CD case. Additional guarantees (commercial guarantees and warranties) Shops or manufacturers will often offer you an additional commercial guarantee (also called a \"warranty\"), either included in the price of the product or at an extra cost. This can give you better protection but can never replace or reduce the minimum 2-year guarantee, which you always have under EU rules. Similarly, if a shop sells you a new product more cheaply and claims that you have no guarantee, this only means that you don't have any additional protection. You always have the right to a 2-year guarantee free of charge if the product turns out to be faulty or not as advertised. Sample story Your 2-year legal guarantee cannot be shortened by a commercial guarantee Carla bought a hairdryer with a 6-month seller's guarantee. When it broke after 8 months, she took it back to the shop. The shop assistant told her that her guarantee had run out and that she was not entitled to a refund. Carla rightly pointed out that she had a full 2-year guarantee free of charge under EU consumer protection law, and that the seller's 6-month guarantee only offered additional services. The shop agreed to replace the hairdryer. Second-hand goods Second\u2013hand goods that you buy from a trader are also covered by the minimum 2-year guarantee. However, goods bought from private individuals are not covered. In some EU countries, when you buy second-hand goods you can agree with the trader on a guarantee period of less than 2 years. However, it must be no shorter than 1 year and should be made clear at the time of purchase. How to get goods repaired, replaced or refunded The 2-year guarantee period starts as soon as you receive your goods. If your goods break within these 2 years, the trader always has to provide a solution for you. In some EU countries you also have the right to request a remedy from the manufacturer. If your product breaks within the first 6 months, it is assumed that the problem existed when you received the goods, unless the trader can prove otherwise. Therefore, you have the right to a repair or replacement free of charge, or if this turns out to be too difficult or costly, you may be offered a price reduction or your money back. If your product breaks after 6 months, you still have the right to have your goods repaired or replaced for free or, at least, to a price reduction or your money back. However, you may need to prove that the problem existed when you received the goods. The European Consumer Centre in your country can help if you have a problem with goods you bought in or from another EU country. For more detailed information about your rights under national law, check the specific rules on legal guarantees and commercial warranties for the country where you made your purchase: Questions on a specific country? Search terms Your right to cancel and return an order 14 day cooling off period In the EU you have the right to return purchases made online or through other types of distance selling, such as by phone, mail order or from a door-to-door salesperson, within 14 days for a full refund. You can do so for any reason \u2013 even if you simply changed your mind. The 14-day cooling off period does not apply to all purchases. Some of the exemptions are: plane and train tickets, as well as concert tickets, hotel bookings, car rental reservations and catering services for specific dates goods and drinks delivered to you by regular delivery \u2013 for example delivery by a milkman goods made to order or clearly personalised \u2013 such as a tailor-made suit sealed audio, video or computer software, such as DVDs, which you have unsealed upon receipt online digital content, if you have already started downloading or streaming it and you agreed that you would lose your right of withdrawal by starting the performance goods bought from a private individual rather than a company/trader urgent repairs and maintenance contracts \u2013 if you call a plumber to repair a leaking shower, you can't cancel the work once you have agreed on the price of the service Please note that this list is not exhaustive. The cooling off period expires 14 days after the day you received your goods. For service contracts, the cooling off period expires 14 days after the day you concluded the contract. If the cooling off period expires on a non-working day, your deadline is extended till the next working day. Sample story You can't change your mind for some types of purchases Jane bought a ticket online for a U2 concert in Ireland. She found out the following day that she would have to be out of the country on the concert date, and triedto cancel her ticket. However, the online trader refused to cancel the order and give her a refund, as the 14 day cooling off period doesn't apply to concert ticket purchases. If you buy goods in a shop, you have no EU legal right to return the goods (for exchange or refund) unless the item is faulty. However, many shops voluntarily allow customers to return or exchange goods during a certain time period, provided you have the receipt. Check your receipt or the returns policy of the shop where you made your purchase for more information. How to cancel a purchase You must tell the trader that you want to cancel your purchase. It is not enough just to send the goods back. The trader must give you a model withdrawal form which you can use to tell them about your decision, but you don't have to use it. You can inform the trader and send back your goods at the same time, for example, by adding a written statement with the goods that you are returning by post, by sending an e-mail, or by completing an online returns form on the trader's website. You must send the goods back within 14 days of informing the trader. Some traders may not charge you for returning your goods. However, they should tell you in advance (before you order) if you will have to pay if you decide to return your order. If they don't tell you that you must pay for your return, the trader will have to pay for it. You don't have to pay any other charges that you were not informed of. For bulky goods (such as large household appliances or furniture), the trader must give you at least an estimate of the cost of returning your order. Bulky goods bought off-premises, such as by catalogue or from a door-to-door salesperson, and delivered to you immediately must always, however, be collected by the trader at their own expense. Getting a refund The trader must give you a refund within 14 days of receiving your cancellation request. However, they can delay refunding you if they haven't received the goods or evidence that you've returned them. Your refund must include any shipping charges you paid when you made your purchase. However, the trader may charge you delivery costs if you specifically requested non-standard delivery (such as express delivery).

For online purchases, you should explicitly acknowledge \u2013 for example by pressing a button \u2013 that you are aware that placing your order implies an obligation to pay. Warning If you want to make an online payment for more than \u20ac30, you will need to use a combination of at least two authentication elements, such as: something you have (such as your mobile phone or card reader) AND something you know (a PIN or a \u200bpassword) something you have (mobile phone or card reader) AND something you are (your fingerprint) something you know (a PIN or a \u200bpassword) AND something you are (your fingerprint) This makes your payments safer and more secure. Surcharges: fees for the use of cards Traders in the EU are not allowed to charge you extra for using your credit or debit card. The only exceptions to this rule are American Express/Diners Club cards and business or corporate credit cards, where your employer is billed instead of you. If you use these cards, you may still be charged a fee but the fee can't be more than what it actually costs the trader to process your payment. You should be aware that if you're paying in EU currencies other than euros, you may still be charged a currency conversion fee by your card provider when you use your card in another EU country. Charges for additional services You must give your consent to any additional payment requested by the trader, for example express delivery, gift wrapping or travel insurance. A trader is not allowed to charge you for these services unless you explicitly selected them. Using a pre-ticked box on the trader's website does not constitute consent, so you would be entitled to have any payment reimbursed which has been collected in that way. Sample story Traders must tell you the full price (including taxes and charges) before you pay Ewa from Poland bought some books from an online trader. However, her credit card was charged more than the final amount displayed at the point of sale on the trader's website. Ewa realised the company had not included delivery costs, and had only added this on after she had completed her purchase. As EU rules oblige traders to display correct and complete pricing information before a customer makes a purchase online, Ewa reported this matter to both the company and the Polish authorities. After intervention by the authorities, she was refunded the difference. Paying in another currency \u2013 conversion charges When you buy a product or service that is priced in another currency, you pay more than just the purchase price. In the same way, when you take out cash from an automatic teller machine in another currency, you pay more than just the amount of the withdrawal. Extra costs may include: a foreign transaction fee charged by your bank or card provider (if you are not paying in euro or withdrawing euro) a currency conversion fee a fee charged by the owner of the ATM When buying something in person or online, you might be offered the choice of paying in the local currency or in your home currency. If you pay in the local currency, you have to wait for your bank statement or credit card bill to find out how much the transaction cost in your home currency. This is often the cheapest option. If you pay in your home currency, you know immediately exactly how much you will be charged. The extra fees often make this option more expensive. If a trader or website offers you the option to pay in your home currency, they must tell you exactly how much extra it will cost. They should express that cost as a percentage mark\u2011up over the latest exchange rates of the European Central Bank\u00a0. Example. A hotel gives you a choice between paying for your stay in the local currency or in your home currency. If you choose your home currency, the hotel should convert the amount of the bill using the ECB rate and inform you of the percentage of mark\u2011up it will add. The website of your bank or card provider must also offer information on these types of charges. In any case, you always have the right to say no and make the payment in the local currency. Price discrimination As an EU national or resident you can't be charged a higher price when buying products or services in the EU just because of your nationality or country of residence. When you buy goods online in the EU, prices may vary from country to country or across different versions of the same website, for example due to differences in delivery costs. However, if you buy goods online without cross-border delivery \u2013 such as when you buy something online which you intend to collect from a trader or shop yourself \u2013 you should have access to the same prices and special offers as buyers living in that EU country. You cannot be charged more or prevented from buying something just because you live in another country. The same rules apply when you buy services provided at the trader's premises, for example when you buy entry tickets for an amusement park, book a hotel, rent a car, or when you buy electronically supplied services (such as cloud services or website hosting), you are entitled to have access to the same prices as local buyers. Warning Copyright protected media, such as films, ebooks and music, are often covered by different licensing agreements in different countries. Therefore you may not always have access to the same products at the same price in all EU countries. Sample story You can't be charged more just because of your country of residence Hilda from Denmark wanted to book a hire car in Spain for her summer holidays. She chose the car she wanted to book on the website of a Spanish car rental company. However, when she entered her address to finalise the reservation, she saw that the total price for her car rental increased by EUR 140. Hilda contacted her local European Consumer Centre to complain about this price discrimination. They helped her introduce a formal complaint, highlighting the discriminatory pricing on the car rental company's website. As the car company failed to comply with EU rules, they may be fined by the competent national authority. Pricing rules for travel tickets EU rules on pricing also apply when you buy travel tickets, such as flights or train tickets, either online or in person. This means that when you buy your tickets, all taxes, fees and charges must be included and appear in the total price from the beginning of the booking process. This makes it easier for you to compare prices with other travel operators. Any optional supplements (such as travel insurance) must be clearly indicated as such and suggested only on an opt-in basis. For the purchase of airline tickets, if you discover unclear online pricing when booking a flight, you can report it to the national authorities in your EU country of residence. Automatic redirection on a website Where several versions of a traders' website exist, you cannot be automatically redirected, unless you give your permission. For example, if you live in France and you choose directly to go to a .be website (Belgium), the trader can suggest that you might want to consult the .fr version of their website. However, unless you give your explicit permission for this redirection, you should have access to the .be website you originally selected. You should also be able to change your choice at any time \u2013 for example, via a \"choose country\" box. This allows you to see the prices and promotions for products and services offered by the trader in other countries. However, you should always check a trader's terms and conditions to understand the delivery options and charges for your country.

Delivery costs You must always be clearly informed of the total price for your purchase, including delivery and other related costs. A trader may charge you a different price to deliver items to another EU country. This can be justified, as postal charges are not the same in all EU countries. Before you buy your goods, the trader must inform you about which cross-border delivery options are available to you and how much they cost. You must give your explicit consent to any additional costs, for example if the trader wishes to offer you express delivery, or gift wrapping. Using a pre-ticked box on the trader's website does not constitute such consent and you would be entitled to reimbursement of any payment which has been collected in this way. Damaged goods The trader is responsible for any damage to your goods from the time they are dispatched until you receive them. Therefore, if when you receive something that you ordered, you discover your goods are faulty or don't work as they should, you are entitled to ask for them to be repaired, replaced, or, where neither is possible, you can ask for a price reduction or refund. Remember that you always have a 2-year minimum guarantee at no cost, regardless of whether you bought your goods in an actual shop or elsewhere, for example online, by catalogue or by phone. Find out more about guarantees and returns. Missing delivery If you don't receive your goods within 30 days, or within the agreed time, you should remind the trader giving them an additional, reasonable time limit to deliver. For example, if the trader has informed you that your delivery is delayed by a week because of problems with his suppliers you should consider giving him that extra week. If the trader still doesn't deliver within the extended deadline then you're entitled to terminate your contract and be reimbursed as soon as possible. You don't have to give the trader extra time if they refuse to deliver or when an agreed delivery period is essential, for example, if you need the goods for a specific event, such as a dress for a wedding, and you have informed the trader of this in advance. Sample story You can cancel an order if goods aren't delivered at the agreed time In mid-November Andrej from Slovakia ordered a case of wine online from Italy for his family's Christmas celebrations. Christmas came and went, without the wine being delivered. As the product was not delivered within 30 days, even though he had reminded the trader and given him some extra time to deliver, Andrej is entitled to a refund from the trader. Parcel delivery charges Companies in the EU delivering parcels cross-border have to submit their public price list every year for publication in an EU tool. You can use this tool to check parcel delivery services you can use when you send a parcel within the EU. The tool only covers letters and parcels weighing at least 500g and up to 5kg. To see the available companies and their prices simply select your country, the country where you want to send your parcel, and a parcel type from the options below. Send from Deliver to Select a parcel type Company namePrice Warning You should always check the final price offer with the parcel delivery company, as their exact price may require precise information, such as the dimensions or weight of your parcel and the postcode in the country where you're sending it. All prices are displayed in the local currency and exclude VAT. Price information is updated every year on 31 March.

Yes - I bought them in the EU No - I bought them outside the EU EU consumer rules cover goods and services that have been bought in the EU.

You can usually only ask for a partial or full refund when it is not possible to repair or replace the goods. Under EU consumer rules you always have the right to a 2-year minimum guarantee at no cost, regardless of whether you bought your goods in a shop, online or through distance selling, such as from a catalogue or by telephone. This 2-year guarantee is your minimum right, however national rules in your country may give you extra protection. Read more about guarantees and returns in your country Warning You might not be entitled to a refund if the problem is minor, such as a scratch on a CD case. Any repair or replacement should be completed within a reasonable time, and without significant inconvenience to you. Additional guarantees (commercial guarantees, warranties) Shops or producers will sometimes offer you an additional commercial guarantee (also called a \"warranty\"), either included in the price of the product or at an extra cost. This can give you better protection but can never replace or reduce the 2-year minimum guarantee, which you always have under EU rules. Similarly, if a shop sells you a new product more cheaply and claims that you have no guarantee, this only means that you don't have any additional protection. You always have the right to a 2-year guarantee free of charge if the product turns out to be faulty or not as advertised. When did your goods break? The goods broke within the first 6 months The goods broke after 6 months but within 2 years The goods broke after 2 years If your goods break within the first 6 months, it is assumed that the problem existed when you received the goods, unless the trader can prove otherwise. Therefore, you have the right to have the goods repaired or replaced free of charge, or if this turns out to be too difficult or costly, you may be offered a price reduction (on your original purchase) or your money back. In some countries, you may have the right to choose freely between these different options. The trader always has to provide a solution.

You can bring home anything you buy in another EU country, without stopping at the border or making a customs declaration. The only condition is that your purchases must be for your own or your family's personal use, and not intended for resale. VAT refunds If you are visiting from outside the EU you are entitled to a VAT refund on goods you have bought during your stay in the EU if the goods are shown to customs on departure within 3 months of their purchase together with the VAT refund documents. These are normally prepared by the seller although, as the scheme is voluntary, not all merchants participate. Some countries set a minimum value of purchases to qualify for a refund. Buying online from another EU country Special rules may apply when you buy goods from another EU country for delivery to your country of residence. If the company you buy from sells goods over a certain value to your country, where the goods are delivered, they cannot charge VAT in the country where you make your purchase. Instead, they have to apply VAT in the country where the goods are delivered \u2013 VAT of destination. The maximum amount for these cross-border sales is set by each EU country at either \u20ac35,000 or \u20ac100,000. This means that most major online retailers delivering within the EU will have to apply the VAT of destination rule. Sample story Sometimes you may pay a higher VAT rate Katrin, from the Netherlands, ordered a book from a large online retailer in Ireland. When she paid for the order and entered her address, she noticed that the price had suddenly gone up. She checked the reason and discovered that the company had charged her Dutch VAT at 9% instead of Irish VAT at 0%. In the Netherlands, the maximum limit to be able to deliver goods without paying Dutch VAT is \u20ac100,000. This means that a company which sold more than \u20ac100,000 in goods to the Netherlands during the previous financial year must apply the VAT rate of the country of destination. The company Katrin has ordered from delivers frequently to the Netherlands and therefore has to charge her Dutch VAT, even though her order is being shipped from Ireland. Warning This rule does not apply to second-hand goods, works of art, collectors' items or antiques. Excise duty If you buy tobacco products or alcoholic drinks online from another EU country, the price will include excise duties, regardless of the quantity and even if the goods are a gift. The trader is responsible for paying the excise duty due in the EU country of destination. You should therefore expect the price for these types of goods to reflect the cost of excise duty. If the price is very low, make sure you check with the seller if the duty has been paid before you make your purchase. If the seller hasn't paid the excise duty, your goods can be seized by customs on arrival or you may be required to pay the excise duty yourself. You should always make sure that the seller will pay the necessary excise duty in the EU country of destination. Warning If you buy goods online from outside the EU, VAT, customs and excise duty is always due. Exception for telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services VAT on telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services is charged in the country where you live (the country where you are established, have your permanent address or usually live), and not in the country from where you purchase the service. These rules apply to services puchased both within and from outside the EU. Sample story VAT on digital content is from the country of residence Senta, lives in Sweden and often purchases eBooks from a Finnish online book seller. The Finnish supplier must charge her Swedish and not Finnish VAT. Exceptions for other services bought online When you buy services online from a trader established in the EU, you pay the VAT rate of the country where the trader is established. This rule also applies if you live in a different EU country from the trader. Sample story Paying VAT in the country where the trader is established Joao runs a consultancy company which is based in Lisbon. He provides consulting services to a private individual living in Copenhagen. As Joao's company is registered in Portugal, he has to charge his Danish customer Portuguese VAT. However, there are many exceptions to this rule. Some of the most common exceptions are: Services provided by an intermediary: VAT is charged in the country where the main transaction with the intermediary takes place. For example,if the owner of a summer cottage in France wants to move some furniture to her home in Sweden and asks an intermediary to find a company that will take care of the removal. French VAT will be due on the intermediary's commission fee because the main supply (i.e. the transportation of goods between 2 EU countries) takes place at the point of departure. Services linked to immovable property are taxed where the property is located. For example, if an architect based in France is hired to design a house in Spain. The architect's fee will be subject to Spanish VAT. Passenger transport is taxed according to the distance covered. For example,if the price of a bus ticket for a journey from Poland to France via Germany will include Polish, German and French VAT, in proportion to the distance covered in each country. If the bus also travels via Switzerland, there will be no EU VAT on that part of the journey, as Switzerland is not an EU country. Restaurant and catering services (other than those on board ships, aircraft or trains) are taxed at the place where the services are physically carried out. For example, if a company based in Luxembourg supplies the food and drinks for an event in Florence. The company must charge Italian VAT. Please note that this list is not exhaustive. Exception for cars For new cars bought in another EU country, VAT is paid in the country where you import and register your car (your country of residence). This VAT scheme also applies to other new means of transport, such as large motorbikes, boats and aircraft. Find out more about paying VAT when you buy a vehicle in another EU country.

Some of the most common are listed below: Bait advertising Sellers are not allowed to advertise products/services at a very low price when they do not have enough stock available. They must tell customers how many items are available for sale and for how long offers remain valid. Sample story Alex saw an advert on offering a special promotion for flights: \"Bask in Barcelona for just \u20ac1!\" When he tried to book the flight, the \u20ac1 ticket was no longer available. He phoned the company's customer services and was told that a very limited number of seats had been offered at the reduced rate. He complained to his national consumer centre. They confirmed that the airline should offer a reasonable number of seats at the advertised price, depending on the scale of the advertising campaign and/or (at least) show the number of seats available at the special price. Although Alex couldn't get a ticket at the advertised price, the national consumer centre advised the company to remove the advert, saving other consumers from falling into the same trap. Phony 'free' offers Sellers must communicate the real prices of their goods and services. They may not portray a paying service as \"free\" or offer you an additional \"free\" service when in fact the real costs of such \"free\" services are already included in the regular price. Sample story Francesca signed up for a text-messaging service. She noticed a box at the bottom of the webpage saying \"5 free texts per day.\" When she clicked, she was taken to another page which again said \"5 FREE TEXTS PER DAY.\" She followed the instructions and was informed that she was now registered and that the charge for the service was \u20ac3 per week. When she checked on the website, she saw in small print that it was a paying service. You should pay close attention to such offers and carefully check the conditions. Manipulation of children Sellers cannot tell your child to ask you to buy their products. Direct appeals like \"Go buy the book now\" or \"Get your parents to buy you this game\" are banned. This ban applies to all media, including television and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 internet. Sample story C\u00e9cile was surprised when her daughter suddenly started ask her to buy a collection of DVDs with her favourite book character. C\u00e9cile understood why, when she saw an advertisement for the release of the DVD set stating, \"Your favourite book is now out on DVD \u2013 tell your mum to buy it for you.\" She consulted a consumer protection authority,. They confirmed this was an unfair practice and filed a complaint against the company in order to stop the campaign. False claims about cures Whenever a product is advertised as therapeutic \u2013 curing allergies, reversing hair loss, helping you lose weight, etc. \u2013 you have the right to know if such claims have been scientifically confirmed. In many cases, claims like these are not medically backed up and are simply too good to be true. Sample story Mario received a letter from a company in another country claiming that their product would help his hair grow back in 3 weeks. Mario decided to order the product, as the letter said that it was \"tried and tested\". However, the product had not in fact been tested and did not work. Mario contacted his national consumer protection authority and learned that plenty of other misled consumers had also complained. He was advised to join the legal proceedings against the company which were already underway. Hidden advertisements in media (advertorials) You have the right to be informed if a newspaper article, TV programme or radio broadcast has been sponsored by a company as a way to advertise its products. This must be made clear by images, words or sound. Sample story Yann read an article in a travel magazine on trekking in Ireland. The article, published as a story by one of the readers, mentioned that a certain brand of equipment used during the trip was particularly good. Yann decided to double check on an online forum and learned that the brand's equipment was not considered to be very good quality. Many forum users said they were tricked into buying it, as they didn't know that the article had been sponsored by the producer of the equipment (known as an \"advertorial\"). When Yann contacted a consumer organisation, he learned that, under EU law, the travel magazine should have made it clear that the article was an advert. The consumer organisation contacted the publisher of the magazine who published a clarification and apologized to its readers for misleading them. Pyramid schemes These are promotional schemes that you pay to join in exchange for the opportunity to receive compensation. That compensation, however, comes primarily from your bringing new people into the scheme. The actual selling or consumption of products plays a minor role. At some point, pyramid schemes collapse, and the last to enter lose their investment. Sample story Oana was offered a job in a marketing network selling beauty products. She was told she would make a lot of money in her spare time from the comfort of her own home. She was asked to pay a one-off entry fee upfront and bring 5 friends into the network. The more friends she introduced to the network, the more money she would earn. Her friends would also earn extra money if they introduced 5 other friends. Oana didn't realise that her main source of income came from recruiting people into the network, rather than from the sale of beauty products. If you find yourself in such a situation, you should a contact consumer organisation who will tell you the redress measures you can use in your country. False offers of prizes, gifts Traders may not advertise free prizes or gifts, and then require you to pay in order to claim them. If you receive a letter or e mail that says: Congratulations, you have won a prize!, be cautious because this may well be an unfair practice. Sample story Evelina received a letter from a company congratulating her for having won a \u20ac100 prize. She was told to call to claim her prize within a week. When she called the number in the letter, she was told that the offer was really just an advertisement. Instead of receiving a prize, she was requested to buy household appliances, after which she would be entered in a lottery. Evelina was upset and decided to check whether the company was allowed to do this. She contacted her national consumer organisation and learned that such practices are banned. The consumer organisation contacted the company, which finally ceased the practice. Phony 'special' advantages Sellers may not claim that they are granting you special rights, when in fact you already enjoy those rights under the law. Sample story Konstantinos from Thessaloniki decided to buy a computer on the internet. He chose an online shop that had a special offer giving buyers a 2-year guarantee covering repairs or replacement if the product turned out to be faulty or not as advertised. Konstantinos was convinced this was a special offer, but the 2-year guarantee is an obligation imposed on every seller by law. Many sellers or manufacturers offer their own commercial guarantees, which promise to repair a product, e.g. for 1, 3 or 5 years. These may be free or for optional purchase. However, these additional commercial guarantees never replace the minimum 2-year guarantee, which you always have from the seller as your legal right. Konstantinos wrote to the trader, who agreed that an error had been made and agreed to give him an extra 1 year commercial guarantee. False use of limited offers When sellers tell you that a particular offer will only be available for a very limited time, they might be trying to pressure you to buy before taking the time to make an informed choice. It is unfair to claim that an offer is limited in time when that is not in fact the case. Sample story Simon from Belgium wanted to buy a bicycle. He found a special offer valid for just 24 hours on a Dutch online shop. The bicycle wasn't exactly what he was looking for, but he didn't have time to compare as the offer was valid only for such a short time. He quickly decided to buy the bicycle to take advantage of the 50% discount. To his surprise, when he browsed the internet shop a week later he saw exactly the same promotion. Simon realised it was a false offer to trick him into buying the bicycle. He complained to the trader but didn't get a response. He then went to the European Consumer Centre in Belgium who transferred the case to their colleagues in the Netherlands. A short time later the Dutch centre told Simon that, thanks to their action, the trader had corrected the website. Persistent unwanted offers Under EU law, companies may not make persistent and unwanted offers to you by telephone, fax, e mail or any other media suitable for distance selling. Sample story Margus went to a shop with kitchen furniture and subscribed to a newsletter on new offers. He then started receiving adverts from magazines on cooking, gardening, parachuting, housekeeping... Although he had never asked to be put on any mailing list, he sometimes got as many as 10 emails a day! Margus's requests to be taken off the mailing list were ignored. A friend advised Margus to contact the national consumer centre, because they had helped her solve a similar problem in the past. Following the centre's action, the company finally took Margus off their list. Warning You may encounter practices that don't fall under the criteria above, but that you consider unfair.

whether it's signing up for gym membership, ordering car tyres online, getting a mortgage for your house or even just buying your weekly shopping from the supermarket. Under EU law, standard contract terms used by traders have to be fair. This doesn't change if they're called \"terms and conditions\" or are part of a detailed contract that you actually have to sign. The contract is not allowed to create an imbalance between your rights and obligations as a consumer and the rights and obligations of sellers and suppliers. Contract terms must be drafted in plain, understandable language. Any ambiguities will be interpreted in your favour. Potentially unfair terms In addition to the general requirement of \"good faith\" and \"balance\", EU rules contain a list of specific terms that may be judged unfair. If specific terms in a contract are unfair, they are not binding on you and the trader may not rely on them. Here are some situations where contract terms may be judged unfair under EU rules: 1. Liability when a consumer dies or is injured Terms which exclude/limit a trader's liability if a consumer dies or is injured because of an act/omission by that trader. Sample story Sam joined his local gym. When he had a closer look at his membership contract, he was surprised to read that the gym doesn't accept responsibility for any harm or injury caused by the use of the facilities and equipment. When he checked, he was told by his national consumer association that a term excluding the trader's liability is not valid. Following an investigation by the national enforcement authority, on the basis of Sam's complaint, a court banned the trader from using such a term in its contracts. 2. Compensation if a trader doesn't deliver Terms which inappropriately exclude/limit consumers' rights to compensation if the trader doesn't keep to his side of the contract. Sample story Costas went on a package holiday with his girlfriend to Kenya for which he paid\u00a0EUR 2 000 per person. The holiday was a disaster: the flight was delayed by 12 hours, the air conditioning in the hotel didn't work, and the safari trip took place, but not in the park they had been promised. They complained to the tour operator and asked for compensation amounting to a total of EUR 5 000 (EUR 4 000 for the cost of the package and EUR 1 000 for lost time and enjoyment). The tour operator only agreed to compensate them EUR 1 000, pointing to a provision in the contract limiting the organiser's liability to 25% of the total cost of the holiday. When Costas asked his local consumer association, they told him that terms which inappropriately limit the trader's liability in case of inadequate contractual performance are most probably unfair. Costas decided to take the tour operator to court to enforce his rights. See also your rights if you are buying a package holiday. 3. Get-out clause in favour of the trader Terms which bind the consumer but allow traders to get out of providing a service just because it doesn't suit them. Sample story Liese was travelling a lot and decided to hire a gardener to come every week to look after her lawn and flowerbeds. But one month in summer the gardener didn't come and the flowers died from lack of water. When Liese complained, the gardener showed her a term in the contract allowing him not to come if he had too much work on for other clients. Liese told the gardener that, according to information she had found on the internet, this clause wasn't valid. She therefore managed to get compensation for the lost flowers and got a formal commitment from the gardener guaranteeing his weekly services. 4. One-sided compensation for cancellation Terms which allow a trader to keep pre-payments if the consumer cancels the contract without allowing for equivalent compensation to the consumer where the trader cancels. Sample story Mary ordered a kitchen for her new apartment. She paid a 30% deposit up-front and the company came to her apartment to take measurements. The furniture was supposed to be ready and installed in 8 weeks. After 2 months Mary called the seller and was told that, unfortunately, it would not be possible to deliver the kitchen for several months. As Mary wanted to move into her new apartment, she cancelled the contract, and bought a kitchen which was in stock in another shop. She then asked for a refund of her deposit. The seller refused to return the deposit, pointing to a contract term stating that if the customer cancels the contract the seller is entitled to keep the deposit. When Mary had a closer look at the contract she discovered that, had the seller decided to cancel the contract, she would not have been entitled to an equivalent compensation. Mary checked with her national consumer association, who told her that the contract clause was unfair. Therefore, Mary contacted the seller again, referred to her contacts with legal experts in the consumer association, and managed to get her deposit refunded. 5. Excessive compensation Terms which require a consumer who doesn't fulfil an obligation to pay an unreasonably high amount of compensation. Sample story Tom rented a car at Malaga airport. He was supposed to return it with a full tank of petrol 3 days later. On the day, there was a traffic jam on the road to the airport because of an accident. Tom didn't want to waste additional time filling the car up with petrol if it meant missing his flight. He returned the car with the tank half empty. Once back home, he saw that he had been charged EUR 45 for the fuel, plus a EUR 150 fee for returning the car with an empty tank. Tom contacted the Europos vartotoj\u0173 centr\u0105 and was told that imposing such disproportionately high fees is unfair. With ECC-net's support, the rental company returned EUR 100. 6. One-sided cancellation Terms which allow a trader to dissolve a contract unilaterally but where the consumer does not enjoy the same right. Sample story Cristina ordered her wedding dress from a fashion designer. 2 weeks before the wedding, she was supposed to meet the designer for a final fitting. When she called him to make an appointment, he told her he'd ended their contract without providing any real justification. Cristina checked with a lawyer friend whether the designer could just cancel the contract like that. Her friend explained it was clearly an unfair term because the contract doesn't give Cristina the same right to cancel. Her friend called the designer and explained the legal situation. The designer contacted Cristina and made an appointment for the fitting. Her dress was ready just in time for the wedding. 7. Cancellation at short notice Terms which authorise a trader to terminate a contract with no fixed end-date at short notice, except where absolutely justified. Sample story Nathalie had a contract with a small local internet provider, with no end date specified. One day she received an e-mail informing her that the contract would be terminated as of the following week. She called the provider and asked for an explanation but they couldn't give any real reason for cancelling the contract at such a short notice. Nathalie contacted a consumer association, who told her such term was most likely unfair. She therefore contacted the internet provider again and managed to get her subscription extended long enough for her to switch to a different provider. 8. Automatic extensions of fixed duration contracts Terms whereby a consumer has to notify an intention to end such contracts but where the deadline for doing so is unreasonably early. Sample story Mark has a 1 year mobile phone contract which he took out 10 months ago. His wife recently switched to a new mobile phone company offering very attractive bundle packs and free calls within the network. Mark decided to switch to this new operator as soon as his contract expired. He checked his contract and found out that, if he wanted to end it, he should have given 6 months' notice. As he hadn't done that, his contract had been automatically extended for another year. Mark was disappointed and decided to contact his national consumer organisation. They informed him it was unfair on the part of the mobile phone company to require so much notice. They advised him to take the matter to court if the company tried to enforce the unfair term. 9. Hidden terms Terms which bind consumers even though they could not easily have been aware of them before signing the contract. Sample story Monika rented an apartment, on a 3 year lease. When she moved in she found out she had to use a specific cleaning service that charged EUR 100 every month, on top of the rent. Sure enough there was a clause in the contract referring to a document about cleaning services. But Monika had never been given this document. Monika searched on the internet and found that hidden terms like this are unfair. She told the owner of the apartment that this additional obligation wasn't fair because she hadn't been informed of it before signing the lease - and she eventually managed to avoid the fixed cost. 10. One-sided changes to the contract Terms which allow the trader to alter a contract unilaterally, unless the contract states a valid reason for doing so. Sample story Pavel took out a loan from his bank to buy a new car. After 8 months, he discovered that his monthly instalments had gone up. When he looked more closely at the contract, Pavel discovered a term authorising the bank to change the interest rate without giving him a chance to end the contract. He contacted his local consumer association for advice. They told him that, as there was no clause giving Pavel the right to terminate the contract, the term allowing the bank to put up the interest rate was unfair. They advised him not to pay the higher interest rate and to file an official complaint with them if the bank refused to review the unfair term.\u00a0Pavel followed their advice and managed to have the contract clause changed. 11. One-sided changes to the product or service Terms which allow a trader to make changes to the product or service to be provided unilaterally and without a valid reason. Sample story Birgit ordered new tiles for her renovated bathroom. She chose white and blue striped tiles. After 4 weeks, the tiles arrived but they were simple white tiles with no stripes. When she contacted the supplier they pointed out that, under the terms and conditions displayed on the order form, if the company was unable to supply an item for whatever reason, it would replace it with an item of equivalent standard and value. Birgit contacted the \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ac \u039a\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd (\u0394\u03af\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bf \u0395\u039a\u039a) and was told it was unfair to have terms and conditions that provided for unilateral changes in the product supplied. With the support of ECC-net, she eventually got her money back. 12. Price variations Terms where the trader can fix the final price on delivery or increase it, without giving consumers the option of cancelling the contract if the amount is much higher than initially agreed. Sample story Thomas signed a 5 year contract for servicing of the central heating system in his new house. After 18 months, he found that the monthly fee had unexpectedly gone up. When he asked for an explanation, the trader pointed to a clause in the contract reserving the company's right to increase its prices for servicing the heating, with written notice of just one month. Thomas checked with his national consumer association, who told him that a term allowing the trader to increase the price of a service without allowing the consumer to cancel the contract was most likely unfair. Thomas decided to cancel the contract instead of paying unforeseen additional costs. 13. One-sided interpretation of the contract Terms where the trader alone has the right to interpret any clause of the contract and to decide whether the product or service complies with the contract. Sample story Krisztina ordered a personalised photo book with pictures of her daughter. When the book arrived she discovered that the cover of the book was not the colour she'd chosen. She complained to the seller but he refused to reprint the book. He referred to the terms and conditions displayed on the order, saying that the delivery is in conformity with the contract when the seller decides it is. Krisztina knew that such terms are unfair and insisted that the trader reprint the book or give her money back. By pointing to her rights, she eventually got the book reprinted at no additional cost. 14. Not honouring statements made by the trader's staff Terms under which a trader tries to dodge commitments made by his staff or where such commitments are subject to other conditions. Sample story Jake bought some shoes in a shop. He did not have time to try them on but the shop assistant told him that, if the size was wrong he could take them back and exchange them. The shoes turned out to be too small, so Jake took them back. But the manager refused the exchange and showed him a written document on the conditions of sale. The document stated that exchanges weren't offered, and that only the rules contained in that document were valid. Jake contacted the \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ac \u039a\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd (\u0394\u03af\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bf \u0395\u039a\u039a) who confirmed the unfairness of the term. With ECC-net's assistance, he soon managed to exchange the shoes for another pair. 15. One-sided compliance with obligations Terms obliging consumers to fulfil all their obligations when the trader doesn't abide by his. Sample story Louise subscribed to a business press review newsletter. She was supposed to receive a press review from all EU countries in English every day. But sometimes there was no newsletter for 2 or 3 days, and not all the news items were translated into English. One month she received just one newsletter. Although the service wasn't working properly, she still received invoices for the full subscription fee. She asked the supplier to reduce the price so she only had to pay for the days when she actually received the service. However, the company refused and pointed out that, according to the contract, the service could be temporarily interrupted without releasing the client from their payment obligations. In the end, the national consumer organisation stepped in. Louise's fee was reduced and the service provider was forced to change the unfair term in the contract. 16. Transfers of contracts to other traders under less favourable conditions Terms which allow the trader to transfer the contract without the consumer's consent and which may give the consumer a worse deal. Sample story Karl ordered a new kitchen from a company that promised a \"10-year guarantee\". The kitchen was to be installed in his apartment in 6 weeks' time. When the day finally came, Karl noticed the kitchen fitters were from a different company. They confirmed that his contract had been transferred to their company. Karl called the new company to check if the 10-year guarantee was still valid. The new company explained that their policy was the usual two-year guarantee and that Karl's contract had given the old company the right to transfer their rights and obligations to the new company. Karl sought advice from a national consumer association. He was told that a clause authorising contractual rights and obligations to be transferred was unfair and, therefore, invalid - when it meant a reduced guarantee. Therefore, Karl was still entitled to the 10-year guarantee against the company from which he ordered the kitchen originally. Based on the consumer's association advice, he managed to get a warranty extension from the former company, which committed to provide him with necessary after-sales services. 17. Limited rights to legal action Terms which restrict how and where consumers can take legal action and obliging them to provide proof which is the responsibility of the other party to the contract. Sample story Alain bought a flight ticket from Paris to Porto for his summer holiday. On his way to the airport, he got stuck in public transport, arrived at the airport 30 minutes late and ended up having to buy a new ticket to get to Porto. When checking-in 2 weeks later at Porto airport, he was shocked to discover that his return flight had been cancelled on the grounds that he had not used the outward ticket. He had no choice but to buy another ticket with the same airline. When boarding the plane, he told the flight attendant that he would start court proceedings to get compensation as soon as he got back to France. The flight attendant told him that, under the airline's standard terms and conditions, he was only allowed to take action in the UK where the airline was based. Alain had a closer look at the terms and conditions on the company's website and found a term stating that any legal action should be brought before a UK court. Alain contacted the Centro Europeo del Consumidor, who told him that a term that limited his legal right to take action was unfair and invalid, so he could take the matter to court in France after all. He also received confirmation that a term providing for the cancellation of a return ticket purely on the grounds that the outward ticket had not been used may, in certain circumstances, be considered as unfair. If you find unfair terms in your contract Contract terms that are unfair under EU law have no legal or binding force on consumers. As long as the unfair term is not an essential element of the contract, the rest of your contract (but not the unfair term) remains valid. This means, for example, that you won't have to give up your gym membership just because one clause in the contract is unfair. EU countries must make sure that consumers know how to exercise these rights under national law, and must have procedures under which business may be prevented from using unfair terms. Throughout the EU, national authorities are in responsible for enforcing\u00a0EU consumer protection rules. If you feel that a particular trader is repeatedly breaching these rules, including at a cross-border level, you should report your case to them. Warning If you feel that particular contract terms are unfair, you can seek advice from: National consumer associations - for advice on problems in the country where you live European Consumer Centres Network (ECC-Net) - for help with cross-border disputes EU legislation EU Directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts Guidance on the interpretation/application of the directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts Affected by Brexit?

Companies are legally obliged to be completely clear about the price you'll have to pay when they advertise or sell something to you. Complete price information The price quoted in an offer must include all taxes and delivery charges. If there might be extra costs that can't be calculated in advance, you must also be told about that upfront. Sample story Taxes and charges must be included in the total price Stefaan, from Belgium, found some very cheap flights to Spain on an airline website. However, after he completed the online booking, the final price had doubled \u2013 including various surcharges that had not been mentioned at any stage of the booking process. Stefaan contacted the customer service department and was told the initial price was indicative. However, a call to the Belgian consumer centre confirmed that, although airlines are indeed entitled to charge extra for things like luggage or in-flight meals, these should be indicated from the start (along with all other additional charges, taxes, etc). Extra costs which are not optional, such as administrative or payment fees, should always be included in the initial price. The airline in question now clearly indicates all price supplements at the start of the booking process. When something is advertised as \"free\", you cannot be obliged to pay anything other than the cost of: responding to the advert collecting the item or having it delivered Easy comparison \u2013 price per unit You should also be able to compare prices between brands and between package sizes \u2013 to see, for example, what saving you'd make buying a large-size box of breakfast cereal instead of a small box. To help you do this, all products must be marked not only with the selling price, but also the price per unit \u2013 for example, the price per kilo or per litre. This information must be understandable, easy to read, and easily identifiable. This rule also applies to adverts that mention a selling price. Sample story Check the unit price of the product you're buying Nadine lives in Luxembourg close to the German border with her 5 month old daughter. To try and save money, she started to compare the price of nappies in different shops both in Luxembourg and across the border in Germany. She found a German seller offering packs of the same nappies she buys in Luxembourg for the same price she normally pays. Looking more closely at the unit price, however, Nadine realised that the German packs contained 140 nappies, whereas the packs in Luxembourg had only 90, making them much more expensive. She switched straight away to buying all her nappies from the German shop. Exceptions The following are examples of goods to which the unit pricing rules might not apply \u2013 because indicating a unit price might cause confusion, or because of the particular nature or purpose of the goods: products sold in vending machines goods sold at auction artworks and antiques Price discrimination is not allowed As an EU national, a trader cannot charge you more when you buy a product or service just because of your nationality or country of residence. Some price differences can be justified if they're based on objective criteria and not just on nationality. For example, differing postage costs may mean you pay more for delivery in one country than in another. However, traders may still set different net sale prices in different points of sale, such as shops and websites, or may target specific offers only to a specific territory within a Member State. Under EU rules, all these offers must be accessible for consumers from other EU countries. However, there is no possible justification for differences in access to goods or services for customers from different EU countries in the following three situations: sale of goods without physical delivery \u2013 for example, if you buy something online that you will collect from a shop, rather than have it delivered to your home sale of electronically supplied services (excluding copyright protected content) \u2013 such as cloud computing services, or website hosting sale of services provided in a specific location \u2013 for example hotel bookings, car hire, tickets for entry to theme parks Where a trader has several country versions of the same website, such as a webshop selling products to different countries across the EU, you should be able to choose to view which version you visit. You must give your permission to be redirected to a specific country version of the website. You should also be able to change your choice at any time.

Find out more on income taxation in Europe. Warning But researchers in the EU can sometimes simply continue paying tax in their home country. This is often the case if you are a visiting PhD student, or if your income comes from a public body in your home country. In that case, your income is covered by the bilateral tax agreements between your home country and your new country of residence. These seek to avoid double taxation, but there is likely to be paperwork to complete before you move. Paying tax as a post-doc Post-doctoral researchers will usually have to pay tax in their country of residence, either as employees of a university/research institution there, or as self-employed workers conducting research in partnership with such institutions. Tax situation by country As the terms of double taxation agreements can vary widely, please check the situation in the country you intend to move to.

They have the right to be placed in a class with their own age group, at the equivalent level to their class in your country of origin - regardless of their language level. Warning As an EU citizen if you move to another EU country for work, your children are entitled to free introductory tuition in your new home country to help them integrate and adapt to the school system there. Part of this initial training includes support to learn the language of your new home country. Be aware that the school system in your new home country may be very different from what you are used to. In some countries, for example, children are separated very early into academic or vocational streams. This is why there is no automatic EU-wide recognition of school certificates. In some countries, you must ask the national authorities to recognise your children's school certificates before you can enrol them in a local school. Questions on a specific country?

At that time, the Danish government provided maintenance grants to Danish students for a maximum of six years. However, there was a four-year cap on the number of years a Danish student could receive this grant if the studies were outside Denmark. Johs was not aware of this condition; as he had been receiving the grant for four years in the United States, he was unfortunately left with no grant during his course in the Netherlands.

You may therefore need to go through a national procedure to get your academic degree or diploma recognised in another EU country, if you seek admission to a further course of study there. If you already know that you will eventually want to pursue further studies in a different country, check before you start whether your diploma will be recognised there. Individual governments of EU countries remain responsible for their education systems and are free to apply their own rules, including whether or not to recognise academic qualifications obtained elsewhere. Sample story Find out whether a country will recognise your foreign diploma Kathrin completed a university degree in Germany. She then moved to France to pursue a postgraduate degree, but found that the French authorities did not recognise her diploma, requesting that she obtain a document certifying her qualifications from a French university. After discussion with a French university, she was able to get her degree recognised as equivalent to a \"licence\" in the French system \u2013 a type of diploma obtained there after only 3 years of study, and which she felt covered much less ground than the studies she had already completed in Germany. Nonetheless, she had to pursue 2 further years of undergraduate study in the French system before she could apply for the postgraduate course she wanted there. Get your degree \"compared\" In most cases, you can obtain a \"statement of comparability\" of your university degree, stating how it compares to the diplomas delivered in the EU country you are moving to. To do so, contact the ENIC/NARIC centre in the country where you would like your diplomas assessed for \"comparability\".\u00a0This could be your home country if you return home after your studies, or another EU country if you move there for work or further study. Depending on the country where your diplomas are assessed and the purpose of the assessment, the ENIC/NARIC centre will either evaluate them itself, or transfer them to the competent authority. Before the assessment, make sure you check: how much the service will cost (if there is a fee) how long the assessment will take \u2013 it could be several weeks to several months depending on the country, the purpose, and the complexity of your file what type of document you will get as a result \u2013 it could be a full equivalency, or a comparative report what you can do if you disagree with the assessment (how to appeal) If you provide documents in the Europass format (such as the Diploma Supplement), your degree can be more easily compared and recognised. Professional qualifications Warning This section concerns the recognition of academic qualifications. A different set of EU rules govern the recognition of professional qualifications in other EU countries \u2013 that is, degrees giving access to a profession, such as nursing or the law.

Joint-degree programmes With Erasmus Mundus, you can enrol in a postgraduate degree programme jointly offered by universities based in different EU countries - in certain cases, even outside Europe. You study or conduct research in at least two countries - and are awarded a joint, double or multiple degree as a result.

Visit the website of the joint masters of your choice for information on entry requirements and the calendar for applications. Partnerships beyond the EU's borders Erasmus Mundus scholarships can also support partnerships with universities from a range of countries and regions across the world.

Income can come from different sources, such as your parents, your spouse, or, of course, work. As an EU citizen, you will have the same right to work while studying as nationals of that country. You will not need a work permit, even to work full-time. More on temporary working restrictions. Several countries allow you to work an unlimited number of hours per week. Others apply limits per term, or per year. More on working in another EU country. Taxes and social security If you live in another EU country for more than 6 months a year there (183 days) you will be considered tax-resident there. Consequently, if you work while studying, you will have to pay taxes and social security contributions on income earned in the country where you study. The country where you study could also tax income earned in a different country, for instance from any summer jobs you may get in your country of origin. You may have to report such income and, in some cases, pay tax on it in the country where you study. Be aware that many \u2013 but not all \u2013 EU countries have agreements to avoid double taxation. These agreements may in some cases determine which country you should pay tax to. More on taxes. Sample story Joost is a Dutch student who moved to Belgium to study. He works part-time at a restaurant on a contract under Belgian law. His employer deducts taxes and social security from his monthly pay checks and pays contributions for him to the Belgian authorities. During his summer holidays, Joost works full-time in his native town in the Netherlands. His employer there pays contributions for him to the Dutch tax authorities. Joost, who is a Belgian resident for tax purposes, can either request a refund from the Dutch authorities and then pay the applicable income taxes in Belgium, or declare the income earned in the Netherlands and the taxes already paid there to have a tax discount from Belgian authorities instead.

You can launch legal proceedings to have the child returned. Central authorities can help you take the necessary steps. Search for central authorities responsible for international child abductions. If your case meets legal requirements, the courts in the EU country where the child was taken to, will decide whether the child should be returned. Possible exceptions if the child might be in danger in the country where they lived before the abduction if the child is old enough to declare that they do not want to return. Both you and your child should have the opportunity to be heard by the court during the proceedings. Reversing a court decision If you want to try to reverse a custody decision, you must go to court in the country where the decision was taken. You cannot reverse a decision on custody by abducting a child and having a court in a different EU country make a different custody ruling. Warning Exceptions These rules do not apply to Denmark, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. However, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland apply the 1980 Hague Convention on Child Abduction. Abduction cases involving these countries are treated according to this convention or other international agreements. Sample story Making sure custody rights are respected Irena and Vincenzo lived in Italy for 14 years, but are now going through a divorce. In 2013, an Italian court gave Vincenzo custody of their daughter Alessandra and ordered her to be placed provisionally in a children's home in Pisa. On the same day, Irena left Italy for Slovenia with her daughter. A Slovenian court recognised the Italian court order and launched the procedure to return Alessandra to her father. But Irena opposed this decision. The Slovenian court gave Irena provisional custody of Alessandra because placing Alessandra in a children's home in Italy could cause irreversible psychological damage. In addition, Alessandra expressed a desire to remain with her mother during the court proceedings in Slovenia. Vincenzo appealed the Slovenian court's decision and won. Alessandra was returned to Italy.

Each EU country applies its own rules. Contact national authorities for information on requirements for adoption and procedures to be followed. All EU countries do, however, share certain principles enshrined in international conventions on adoption: if alive, the child's biological parents must freely agree to the adoption the adoption must be decided in the interest of the child the adoption must be granted by a court or administrative authority. In most EU countries, the child will be able to take your surname and nationality, and should have the same inheritance rights as a biological child. As an adoptive parent, you will have the same rights and obligations towards your child as any other parent. Questions on a specific country?

You also have the right to represent them legally. In all EU countries, a mother automatically has parental responsibility for her child, as does a married father. In most cases, parents exercise this responsibility jointly. The rules on whether an unmarried father has these rights and duties differ depending on the country. Find out about parental responsibility rules in the country relevant to you: Choose country: Austriaaten Belgiumbeen Bulgariabgen Croatiacren Cypruscyen Czechiaczen Denmarkdken Estoniaeeen Finlandfien Francefrfr Germanydeen Greecegren Hungaryhuen Irelandieen Italyiten Latvialven Lithuanialten Luxembourgluen Maltamten Netherlandsnlen Polandplen Portugalpten Romaniaroen Slovakiasken Sloveniasien Spainesen Swedenseen Still have questions? Search terms Custody and visiting rights The rules on custody and visiting rights are unique to each EU country. National laws determine: who will have custody whether custody will be single or shared who will decide on the child's education who will administer the child's property, and similar issues. However, all EU countries recognise that children have the right to a personal relationship and direct contact with both parents, even if the parents live in different countries. In cases of divorce or separation, it is important to determine whether the children will live with one parent exclusively or with both alternately. You and your former partner may seek a mutual agreement on this. Going to court over custody and visiting rights If you cannot reach agreement on custody or visiting rights, you will probably go to a court. In situations involving more than one country, for example if the parents do not live in the same country, the courts responsible for handling cases of parental responsibility are those in the country where the child usually lives. If you expressly agree with your spouse, the court ruling on your divorce can also rule on parental responsibility matters connected to your divorce. The court will decide in the best interests of the child on your custody rights, visiting arrangements and determine the child's place of residence. Recognition and enforcement Court decisions on parental responsibility made in an EU country are recognised in all EU countries without the necessity for any additional procedure. Their enforcement is facilitated by a standard procedure. Find out how decisions on parental responsibility taken in one EU country can be recognised and enforced in another one.

Find out about the rights of civil or registered partners. If you live together with a partner in a stable and continuous way, you have some EU-wide rights, even if you have not registered your partnership with any authority. Moving to another EU country If you move with your de facto partner to another EU country, that country must facilitate their entry and residence there - whether your partner is an EU national or not. You must be able to prove you live together or that you are in a long-term relationship. However, most EU countries have not defined exactly how you can prove a long-term relationship or cohabitation. Rights and obligations In EU countries which recognise de facto unions, you will also have rights and obligations concerning property, inheritance and maintenance payments following a separation. These rights are particularly important for same-sex couples, as not all EU countries allow them to get married or register their partnership in any way. Cohabitation contracts If you live in a country where you cannot get married, you cannot enter into a registered partnership, or if you choose not to do either, you could set up a cohabitation contract with your partner and settle practical or legal aspects of your cohabitation. In practice, however, even with such a cohabitation contract it may still be difficult for you to enforce your rights. If conflicts about property arise, the law of the country where the conflict occurred will generally apply. FAQs FAQs - Unmarried couples Need support from assistance services?

The rules vary greatly from one EU country to another. However, a number of EU rules help determine which courts have jurisdiction and which law applies in cases involving two or more EU countries \u2013 for instance, because you and your spouse live in different countries or have different nationalities. Where can you file for divorce or separation? You can request a divorce or legal separation together with your partner as a joint application, or alone. You can file your request with the courts in the country where: you and your spouse live you last lived together \u2013 provided one of you still lives there one of you lives \u2013 provided you are filing a joint application your spouse lives you live, if: you have lived there for at least 6 months immediately before filing and you are a national of that country. If you are not a national, you can file only if you have lived there for at least 1 year immediately before filing. both you and your spouse are nationals. The first court where the request is filed that meets these conditions has powers to rule on your divorce. The court with powers to transform a legal separation into a divorce is the court in the EU country that ruled on the legal separation - as long as this is in line with that country's rules. The court with powers to rule on divorce may also decide on issues relating to parental responsibility if the child lives in that country. Which laws apply to your divorce or separation? Are two or more EU countries involved - for instance because you and your spouse have different nationalities or live in an EU country other than your own? The law that governs your divorce is not necessarily the law of the country where you file for divorce. 17 EU countries have adopted a single set of rules to determine which law should apply to cross-border divorces. These countries are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. In any of these 17 countries, you can agree with your spouse to apply the divorce laws of: the country where you and your spouse live the country where you last lived together \u2013 if one of you still lives there the country either of you is a national or the country where you are filing for divorce If you don't agree with your spouse, courts in these 17 countries will apply the laws of: the country where you and your spouse live failing that, of the country where you last lived together \u2013 provided you still lived together there 1 year before going to court failing that, of the country you're both nationals of failing that, the country where you are filing for divorce If you are applying for divorce in another EU country, consult a specialised lawyer to see which laws will apply to your case and what the consequences would be. Recognition of divorces and legal separations abroad A divorce or a legal separation granted in one EU country is recognised automatically by other EU countries: there is no need to go through any additional procedure. Warning Exception \u2013 Denmark EU rules on divorce and legal separation \u2013 for instance on jurisdiction and recognition \u2013 do not apply to Denmark.

EU rules on public documents simplify this process and set out the guidelines public authorities must follow when handling your documents issued in another EU country. When you present a document (an original or its certified copy) issued by the authorities in one EU country to the authorities in another EU country, the authorities there must accept your document as authentic without an apostille stamp to prove its authenticity. Types of documents covered by EU rules You can present public documents without an apostille stamp in the following areas: birth the fact of a person being alive death name marriage, including capacity to marry and marital status divorce legal separation or marriage annulment registered partnership, including capacity to enter into a registered partnership and registered partnership status dissolution of a registered partnership, legal separation or annulment of a registered partnership parenthood adoption domicile and/or residence nationality absence of a criminal record and the right to vote and stand as a candidate in municipal elections and elections to the European Parliament. Warning These rules only apply to the authenticity of public documents, not the recognition of their legal effects outside the EU country where they were issued \u2013 this aspect is governed by the national law of the EU country where the document is presented. For example, if you have a same-sex marriage certificate issued in one EU country, the authorities of another EU country where you may present the certificate cannot require an apostille stamp for your certificate, but will not be obliged to recognise the marriage if same-sex marriage is not legally recognised in that country. Translation requirements You do not have to provide an official translation of your document if it is in one of the official languages of the EU country where you are presenting it or if it is in another non-official language accepted by that country. In other cases, you can ask the authorities of the EU country that issued your document to provide a multilingual standard form. You need to present this form together with the document, instead of presenting a translation of your document. Check the areas in which you can request a multilingual standard form in your EU country. Warning When you present a multilingual standard form together with your public document, the authorities of the EU country where you present the form may\u00a0exceptionally ask you to provide a certified translation of the document if they cannot fully understand its contents. Sample story Getting a birth certificate issued in an EU country accepted as an authentic document in another EU country Tamas, a Polish citizen is getting married in Belgium to Marie a Belgian citizen. Before they can go ahead with the wedding, Tamas must submit his birth certificate to the Belgian authorities. Tamas does not need to get an apostille stamp to prove that his birth certificate is authentic, nor does he need a certified translation of his birth certificate. Instead, he can simply request a multilingual standard form from the Polish authorities and present it as a translation aid together with his birth certificate.

support for family members Rules on maintenance obligations vary from EU country to country, and the degree of support is not the same everywhere. However, EU rules apply if you need to provide or receive maintenance to or from someone in another EU country. Where can you file a request concerning maintenance? You can file a request concerning maintenance mainly with the courts: in the country where your ex-partner or relative lives; in the country where the person with a claim to maintenance lives; responsible for cases involving your marital status (a divorce for example) or parental responsibility \u2013 if the matter concerning maintenance is related to such cases. If your ex-spouse or relative agrees and subject to certain conditions, you may jointly choose which court should examine your case.This however does not apply if the dispute concerns maintenance obligations towards a child under 18. Which laws apply to my maintenance case? In cases involving two or more EU countries, the law governing maintenance is not necessarily the law of the country where you can file your request. Find out which laws apply to your maintenance case, how a conflict of laws could be solved and what the consequences would be. The central authority responsible for maintenance in the EU country where you live can help you introduce a maintenance request abroad: search for the relevant central authority. Enforcing maintenance rulings abroad A maintenance ruling made and declared enforceable in one EU country will be enforceable in any other EU country. Warning Exception - Denmark For decisions made in Denmark there is a simplified procedure for declaring maintenance rulings enforceable. The central authority responsible for maintenance in the EU country where you live can help you recover maintenance: search for the relevant central authority. Check national information on enforcement measures, the simplified EU procedure on enforcing maintenance rulings and the authorities which handle them, for the country relevant to you.

International couples refers to marriages and registered partnerships between citizens of EU or non-EU nationality who: live in the EU and have different nationalities, or live in an EU country that is not their country of origin, or do not live in the EU but have assets in an EU country. Rules and procedures EU rules on the property regimes of international couples apply in 18 EU countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. These rules determine: the EU country court competent to deal with a case on the couple's property regimes the law applicable to the case (it can be the law of an EU country or the law of a non-EU country, and the rules for the recognition and enforcement in an EU country of a decisions\u00a0given in another EU country. Warning Poland, Hungary, Denmark, Ireland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,\u00a0Slovakia and Romania do not apply EU rules on property regimes for international couples. National law applies in these countries. EU rules on the property regimes of internaional couples do not cover issues related to: the legal rights of spouses or partners the existence, validity or recognition of a marriage or partnership (the competence to define family and marriage falls under national law) maintenance obligations between spouses or partners after a separation or divorce the succession to the estate of the deceased spouse or partner. Sample story EU rules on property regimes bring legal certainty Alain, a French national is married to Marie a Belgian national. They got married in Belgium and live there permanently. In the absence of a choice of law agreement, their\u00a0property regime will be goverened by Belgian law. A couple of years later they bought a holiday house in France in addition to their property in Belgium. Should the couple divorce, the EU country court competent to handle their divorce will also deal with the division of their property (this will include their properties in both France and Belgium). Which country has jurisdiction? Death, divorce / legal separation, dissolution of registered partnership In case of the death of your spouse / partner, the EU country court competent to deal with the inheritance of your spouse / partner will also deal with your couple's property regime matters. Similarily, the EU country court competent to deal with your divorce / legal separation or the dissolution of your registered partnership will deal with your couple's property regime matters. Other cases In other cases, the competent court to deal with your couple's property regimes will be the court in the EU country: of the current usual residence of both spouses / partners, or failing that of the last usual residence of both spouses / partners, or failing that of the usual residence of the respondent, or failing that of the common nationality of spouses / partners, or failing that under whose law the registered partnership was registered. Choice of court agreement Other than in cases of inheritance or divorce / legal separation or dissolution of the registered partnership, as a spouse or registered partner you can agree with your spouse or partner to draw up a choice of court agreement (in writing, signed and dated by both parties). You can select either: the courts of the EU country whose law is applicable to your property regime or the courts of the EU country where your marriage was concluded or where your partnership is registered. If an EU country considers that the marriage or registered partnership cannot be recognised for the purposes of property regime proceedings, you may submit your case to a court in any other EU country where a connecting factor exists. Applicable law and choice of-law agreement As a spouse or registered partner, you can agree with your spouse or partner to draw up a formal choice of law agreement (in writing, signed and dated by both parties) to choose the law that will apply to your property regime. A choice of law agreement can be drawn up before, on entering or during the marriage or registered partnership. The spouses or partners can choose the law of: the country of residence of both or either spouses / partners or, the country of nationality of either spouse or partner, or the country where your partnership is registered, if you are in a registered partnership. Warning Under EU rules, the law of the country (an EU or non-EU country) that applies to your property regime covers all your assets regardless of their location. If you have not made a formal choice of law agreement, the applicable law will be the law of the country: of the spouse's first common habitual residence following marriage of the spouses common nationality at the time of the marriage with which the spouses jointly have the closest connection at the time of the marriage, taking into account all the circumstances where your partnership is registered, if you are in a registered partnership. Recognition and enforcement of court decisions Court decisions on property matters given in one EU country are recognised in other EU countries without any special procedure. However, their enforcement is not automatic and requires a declaration of enforceability. The EU country of enforcement can refuse to recognise the court decision if it: is clearly incompatible with public policy contradicts any previous court decision on the same matter. Authentic instruments (often notarial acts) are recognised and enforced in the same way as court decisions.

Civil unions allow 2 people who live together as a couple to register their relationship with the relevant public authority in their country of residence. Differences between EU countries in this field are huge, and include: whether you can enter into a civil union in a specific country what a civil union entitles you to whether a specific country recognises a civil union contracted abroad Check which rules apply to you Are two or more EU countries involved \u2013 for instance because you move after registering, or register abroad? Property rights and maintenance rights for people in registered partnerships are not applied the same way in all EU countries. The rights coming from your registered partnership in one country may be substantially different in another. Find out which country's laws apply to your partnership \u2013 they will have important consequences for your rights and obligations as registered partners. Recognition of civil unions Civil unions and registered partnerships are considered equivalent or comparable to marriage in some EU countries. All countries that allow same-sex marriages generally recognise same-sex registered partnerships concluded in other countries. In countries which do not allow same-sex marriages but which have introduced some form of registered partnership, a same-sex marriage abroad generally gives you the same rights as a registered partnership. However, the laws of these EU countries do not provide for registered partnerships: Bulgaria Latvia Lithuania Poland Romania Slovakia Moving abroad with your civil partner Where civil unions are considered equivalent or comparable to marriage, they give you the same rights for immigration purposes: your registered partner will be entitled to come with you if you settle in these countries. If you want to move to an EU country which does not recognise registered partnerships at all, your partnership will be considered as a duly attested long-term relationship. Your host country must facilitate the entry and residence of your partner. Read more on your right to residence abroad Sample story Able to stay \u2013 thanks to registered partnership Nina is an entrepreneur from EU country \"A\" who was exploring a business opportunity in country \"B\" and wanted her registered partner Hans \u2013 unemployed at the time \u2013 to join her there. Although country \"B\" does not recognise registered partnerships, the existence of the partnership served as proof that the two had a long-term relationship, and Hans was allowed to move there with Nina, even without financial resources of his own.

The authority dealing with the inheritance will usually apply the national law of the EU country where the deceased last lived \u2013 unless the deceased had made a choice of law so that the law of their country of nationality would apply to their inheritance. Possibility for heirs to choose the court If an inheritance issue needs to be resolved by a court, as an heir you will usually have to go to the courts of the EU country where the deceased last lived. However, if the deceased chose the law of their nationality to apply to their inheritance and that is the nationality of an EU country you and the other heirs or parties concerned can agree to bring the issue to the courts of that EU country. All concerned must agree on this choice of court. Accepting or waiving an inheritance or succession The national law that applies to the inheritance may allow you to declare before a court if you accept or waive a succession. Under EU rules, you can make such a declaration before a court in the EU country in which you live, even if the court dealing with the inheritance is located in another EU country. Effects of court decisions given in another EU country A court decision on inheritance given in an EU country will be recognised in other EU countries without any special procedure. However, if the party in the other EU country does not voluntarily comply with the court decision, you can apply for the decision to be declared enforceable so that the police or a bailiff can then intervene to enforce the decision. The other party may only appeal against the recognition or enforceability of the decision for the following reasons: the decision is clearly incompatible with the public policy of the EU country in which it should be recognised or enforced: for example, because it is discriminatory the decision contradicts previous court decisions of the EU country in which it should be recognised or enforced any of the persons involved in the proceeding were not given a chance to prepare their defence Warning Decisions issued by courts in Denmark and Ireland do not benefit from these simplified rules when they need to be recognised or enforced in another EU country. The European Certificate of Succession If you are an heir, you may need to prove to an authority or a bank in another EU country that you are entitled to the ownership of the deceased's assets located there. The executor of the will and the administrator of the estate may also need to prove their status to exercise their rights in another EU country. Sample story Piotr from Poland dies in Germany while living there as a posted worker for one year. Gosia, Piotr's wife and heir, lives in Poland and, following Piotr's death, needs to access his German bank account to pay bills and the last month of rent. However, the bank requests an official document proving that she is Piotr's heir and is authorised to access his account. Administrative barriers thus make grief even harder to bear. The authority of the EU country handling the inheritance or succession can provide you with a national document certifying your status as an heir, executor of the will or administrator of the estate. Alternatively, you can ask that authority to provide you with a European Certificate of Succession. The advantage of a European Certificate of Succession is that its effects are the same throughout the EU regardless of the country in which it is issued. A national document, on the other hand, will have different effects depending on the EU country in which it is issued; this may delay the recognition of your rights in another EU country. In addition, the European Certificate of Succession is recognised in other EU countries without any special procedure. You can get a European Certificate of Succession from a court in the EU country with the power to rule on the inheritance, or from another competent authority - for example, a notary - in the same country. You can appeal against a refusal to issue a European Certificate of Succession. The authority that issues the European Certificate of Succession will keep the original and will issue certified copies to the heir, executor of the will or administrator of the estate, valid for a period of 6 months, which can be extended. The issuing authority can modify or withdraw the European Certificate of Succession if it turns out it is not accurate. Sample story Piotr died in Germany while living and working there temporarily. His life was however centred in Poland, where his wife Gosia and other family and friends live. This is why Polish authorities are in charge of Piotr's inheritance. Gosia gets a European Certificate of Succession from the Polish courts. She can use it to prove to Piotr's bank in Germany that she is entitled to access his account there, and use her late husband's money to pay his bills and last month of rent.

often a court or a notary \u2013 in the EU country where you last lived. This authority will in most cases apply its own national law to your inheritance. EU rules however allow you to choose that the law of your country of nationality should apply to your inheritance \u2013 whether this is an EU country or not. If you have several nationalities, you can choose the law of any of your nationalities. You should express your choice of law explicitly and clearly, in a will or in a separate declaration. Your will or declaration will be considered valid if it meets the requirements of: the EU country where you last lived, or the law of your country of nationality, if you so choose. When authorities can refuse to apply your choice of law EU rules on inheritance do not apply in Denmark and Ireland. If your heirs decide to settle your inheritance with an authority in these countries, your choice of law may not be taken into account. However, Danish and Irish citizens can benefit from these EU rules and choose the law of their nationality for their inheritance if this is handled in an EU country other than Denmark and Ireland. The authority of the EU country that handles your inheritance or succession can refuse to apply certain provisions of the law of your nationality if they are contrary to local public policy. For example, authorities could refuse to apply provisions if these discriminate between heirs based on their sex or on whether they were born in or out of wedlock. What the law applicable to your inheritance will govern The national law applicable to your inheritance, whether it is the law of the EU country where you last lived or the law of your home country, will govern the inheritance of all your assets, regardless of their location and of whether they are movable (for example, a car or a bank account) or immovable (for example, a house). That national law will determine issues such as: who the beneficiaries of your inheritance are: for example, your spouse/partner, your children, your parents whether you can disinherit a family member whether some parts of your estate should be reserved for certain persons: for example, your children whether any gifts you made during your life should be restored to your estate before the estate is transferred to your heirs the transfer of ownership of your assets to your heirs the powers of your heirs, of the executors of your will and of the administrators of the estate, including conditions to sell property and pay any creditors you may have who should be liable for any debts you leave behind how your assets should be shared among your heirs EU rules on inheritance do not determine which authority will handle or which law will apply to certain matters linked to succession, such as: the inheritance taxes that your heirs will have to pay on your estate your civil status: for example, who your last spouse was the property regime of your marriage or registered partnership: that is, how your property should be divided after the death of your spouse or partner matters concerning companies: for example, what will happen to the shares you own in a company Sample story Brian is an Irish pensioner who moved to France upon retirement, where he owns a house and has been living for more than 8 years \u2013 the last 5 with his partner Anne. As Brian lived in France, it may be convenient for Brian's heirs to settle the inheritance with a notary in France. French law will in principle govern Brian's inheritance as France was the last country where he lived. French law will thus determine who is to inherit, including what shares of the estate should be reserved for Brian's children and what are Anne's rights to the estate given that Brian and Anne were not married. Irish law gives Brian more freedom to decide who should inherit his estate. That is why he decides to indicate in his will that Irish law should apply to his inheritance, and designates Anne to inherit all of his French property.

Your health insurer can cover all the costs directly: This system applies to public health care providers - it does not cover private treatment. You must ask your insurer for prior authorisation before travelling for treatment. If granted, you will then be provided with the appropriate authorisation form (called an S2 form) The cost of your medical treatment will be covered by your health insurer according to the reimbursement rates in the country where you're treated. Reimbursement will usually be arranged directly between the institutions involved, so you won't have to pay for the treatment. If you're being treated in a country where patients usually pay for treatment and are reimbursed by their health insurer afterwards, you may have to pay some costs upfront. You can then ask for reimbursement from the relevant authority in the country where you are treated. They will reimburse you directly at the same rate as people insured in that country. You can also choose to ask your insurer to reimburse you when you get back home. If the reimbursement rate for the treatment you received abroad is higher in the country where you are insured, you are entitled to and can apply for a supplementary reimbursement from your health insurer to cover the difference. 2. You can pay for the treatment yourself and claim reimbursement afterwards: This option covers all providers, both public and private. You will be reimbursed up to the amount that specific treatment costs in your home country, but only if you are entitled to that treatment at home. You might still have to apply for prior authorisation for hospital treatment or highly specialised and expensive treatment - check with your National Contact Point. Warning Reimbursement without prior authorisation is not applicable in Switzerland. Sample story 1 You don't always need prior authorisation, but it's better to have it Hugo wants to have treatment for cataracts (which is covered by his health insurance) in Germany. However, the treatment costs more in Germany than it does in his home country. Hugo wants the full cost to be covered, so he must apply to his health insurer for prior authorisation. If he gets the authorisation, he can go abroad and have the treatment, and the full cost should usually be reimbursed directly between the institutions involved. If Hugo has to pay from the treatment himself, he will be reimbursed afterwards in his home country. Yvonne wants to receive the same cataract treatment, again in Germany, and once again it is normally covered by her health insurer. She wants to get the treatment as soon as possible. Yvonne checks with the National Contact Point in her home country to see if she has to apply for prior authorisation and finds that she doesn't have to do so. She therefore goes abroad and gets the treatment. Yvonne pays for the treatment herself and claims back some reimbursement from her health insurer when she gets home. As she didn't get prior authorisation and the treatment cost slightly more in Germany, Yvonne has to pay some of the costs herself. Without prior authorisation, her health insurer only reimburses up to the rate set in her home country. Sample story 2 You may need to pay some costs upfront, even with prior authorisation Agata wants to get her complex surgery performed in Finland at a hospital which is part of the public health system. As this surgery is subject to prior authorisation under either the direct payment or reimbursement routes, she applies for prior authorisation and, if authorised, gets the cost covered directly. Bernard wants the same surgery, also in Finland, but at a private hospital. In this case he must still apply for prior authorisation, but the direct payment option doesn't apply. If he gets prior authorisation, Bernard has to pay the cost of surgery and then claim reimbursement. He should receive reimbursement up to the level applied in his home country for the same kind of surgery. Whichever option you choose, your health insurer cannot refuse your request for prior authorisation if: the specific treatment you need is not available in your home country, but is covered by your statutory health insurance, and you can't get the treatment you need without undue delay in your country, considering your current state of health and the course of your illness You can find out more about relevant costs and reimbursements either directly from the healthcare provider or from the National Contact Point in the EU country where you want to be treated.

However, some countries may restrict access to certain types of healthcare abroad (e.g hospital treatment or highly specialised and expensive treatment). You will also usually need prior authorisation from your health insurer before you organise your medical treatment abroad. Depending on the type of treatment you need and the rules in your country, you may be able to get some or all of your costs covered. Read more about expenses and reimbursements for your planned medical treatment. How to organise your treatment abroad 1. Check your health cover Before you go abroad for medical treatment, you will need to: check whether the treatment is among the benefits that you're entitled to at home check if you need prior authorisation from your health insurer (authorisation is required for hospital treatment in most cases) check if the cost of your treatment will be reimbursed and, if so, check the reimbursement rate 2. Find a place to get your treatment You will need to find a healthcare provider (hospital, medical establishment, etc) offering the treatment you need in another EU country. To do this, you can: ask your local health insurer ask your National Contact Point for planned medical treatment in your home country or in the country where you are considering treatment find a provider yourself directly Be aware that healthcare systems in other EU countries may not work in the same way as healthcare in your home country. Sample story Check with your National Contact Point and health insurer before organising your treatment Aur\u00e9lie lives in France. She needs to undergo surgery and has found a specialist clinic in Luxembourg, where her parents live. She has found a suitable specialist at a public hospital near her parents' house, but isn't certain how to go about organising her treatment there. Aur\u00e9lie decided to call the National Contact Point in France and her local health insurance institution.

If you are entitled to reimbursement you can claim it from your health insurer when you get home. This depends on your healthcare cover and the rules of the EU country you're visiting. Using the EHIC at the pharmacy The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles you to receive necessary treatment with the same rights to health care as people insured in the country you are in. If you have a prescription from the country you are in, you should present it together with the EHIC when you go to the pharmacy. This means that you will pay the same rate at the pharmacy as someone who was insured and living in that country. In some EU countries this may mean that you won't pay anything, while in others you may be required to pay a certain amount towards the cost of your prescription. If you don't have an EHIC or you have a cross-border prescription You will most likely have to pay the full cost of a product dispensed on prescription at the pharmacy if: you don't have an EHIC or have forgotten to take your EHIC abroad with you, or you have private travel insurance, and you have a prescription from another EU country (cross-border prescription) Make sure you ask the pharmacy for a receipt. You should then request reimbursement from your insurer when you return to your home country. Sample story You may have to pay for your prescription medicine Federica has a prescription from her doctor in Italy for allergy medicine that she thinks she might need during her summer holiday in France. In Italy the medicine is dispensed free of charge. During her holiday in France, Federica takes her Italian prescription to the pharmacy to get her allergy medicine. She is surprised when the pharmacist asks her to pay \u20ac25 for her medicine. If you have a prescription from another EU country and you want to have it dispensed abroad, you will most likely have to pay the full price of the medicine at the pharmacy. However, you may be entitled to reimbursement when you get home.

However, a medicine prescribed in one country might not be available or it may have another name. You can ask your doctor to give you a prescription to use in another EU country, also known as a \"cross-border prescription\". Warning Some medicines may not be authorised for sale or may not be available in another country, even within the EU. A prescription with the right information There is no specific form or format for a prescription you will use in another EU country. In most cases, the prescription you would use in your home country should already contain enough information for you to use it in another EU country. It has to contain at least the following information: Patient details: surname and first name (both written in full), and date of birth Date of issue of the prescription Details of the prescribing doctor: surname and first name (written in full), professional qualification, direct contact details, work address (including the country), and signature (written or digital) Details of the prescribed product: its common name (rather than the brand name, which may be different in another country), format (tablet, solution, etc), quantity, strength and dosage. If you think you'll need to get your prescription dispensed abroad, or if you are given a prescription abroad that you will need to get dispensed in your home country, check that the doctor has included all this information. That way you can be sure that a pharmacist in another EU country can easily understand the prescription and correctly identify the medicine you are requesting and its dose. Warning Prescriptions are subject to the rules of the country where they are dispensed. This means that a pharmacist will apply national rules when dispensing your medicine \u2013 for example, you may not be allowed the same number of days' dosage. E-prescriptions If your doctor has given you an e-prescription you will usually need to make sure you ask for a paper copy if you plan to use the prescription in another EU country, as the e-prescription may not be recognised outside your home country. However, e-prescriptions issued in Finland can be used in Croatia and Estonia without the need for a paper copy.

Differences in national systems Health care and social security systems vary from one EU country to another. In some countries you might have to pay the doctor or the hospital directly for treatment, even though you may not normally do that in your home country. You can find information about the healthcare system in the country you visit from a national healthcare institution, a national contact point, through the EHIC smartphone application, or by selecting a country from the list below: Choose country: Austriaaten Belgiumbeen Bulgariabgen Croatiacren Cypruscyen Czech Republicczen Denmarkdken Estoniaeeen Finlandfien Francefren Germanydeen Greecegren Hungaryhuen Icelandisen Irelandieen Italyiten Latvialven Liechtensteinlien Lithuanialten Luxembourgluen Maltamten Netherlandsnlen Norwaynoen Polandplen Portugalpten Romaniaroen Slovakiasken Sloveniasien Spainesen Swedenseen Switzerlandchen Still have questions? Search terms Warning The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is only accepted by doctors or hospitals affiliated to the statutory health care system - private health care is not covered. If you use private health care, you may be able to claim reimbursement when you get home - but you should check your rights first, as reimbursement rules can vary. Sample story Make sure you're treated under the local public health care system Despite having a broken arm, Ewa went on a business trip to another EU country. While she was there, her arm started to hurt, so she went to see a doctor. When she got home, she received a bill for the treatment. She discovered that the cost was not covered by her insurer under the EHIC system because the doctor had treated her as a private patient. Ewa was able to claim some money back from her insurer, but not all of it, as the cost of the treatment abroad was higher than in her own country. Find out more about payments and reimbursements for unplanned medical treatment. If you travel abroad specifically for medical treatment, you will be covered under different rules.

With your EHIC you can get healthcare - and claim reimbursement for the costs you incur - on the same terms as nationals of the country you are in. If the treatment you need is free for local residents, you won't have to pay. If you have to pay for your treatment, you can either ask for reimbursement from the national institution whilst still in the country and get reimbursement directly there, or ask for reimbursement from your health insurer when you get home. Your expenses will be reimbursed according to the rules and rates of the country where the treatment was received. So you will either be reimbursed for the full cost of the treatment, or you will have to pay the patient's fee according to the rules of the country where you were treated. Alternatively, your insurer may decide to reimburse the full cost according to its own rules. Each EU country has at least one National Contact Point that can assist you with questions on reimbursement. Sample story Find out about social security rules in the country you're visiting Anna has statutory health insurance cover in France and is spending a few months in Belgium to finish her studies. She has her European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) with her, issued in France. She is pregnant and will give birth while in Belgium. Pregnancy and childbirth are considered urgent medical care, so Anna will get the necessary medical assistance in Belgium when she presents her EHIC and identity card. Anna will be treated in Belgium as if she were insured in that country. This means that if treatment is free for people insured there, it will be free for Anna too. If people pay and then apply for reimbursement, Anna will pay the same fees as locally insured people, then apply for reimbursement. She should apply for reimbursement in Belgium, where she will be reimbursed at the same rate as people insured there. Belgium will then liaise with health authorities in France, where Anna is insured, to get their money back. However, if the only reason for Anna's stay in Belgium is to have her baby there, the European Health Insurance Card could be refused: she should instead make arrangements for her childbirth needs abroad before leaving for Belgium. That way, she can be sure which costs will be covered. Without a European Health Insurance Card If you don't have your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or you are not able to use it (for example, at a private hospital which is not covered by the EHIC scheme), you may be asked to pay for your treatment. You can then claim reimbursement from your health insurer when you get home. This applies to both public and private healthcare providers. However, the terms will be different: only treatments which you are entitled to receive at home will be reimbursed you will be reimbursed only up to the cost of treatment in your home country \u2013 which may be less than you paid for the treatment If you need urgent treatment, your local health authority might be able to help by faxing or emailing proof of your health insurance coverage to avoid you having to pay upfront. If you're not sure about your entitlements and want to check before getting treatment, each EU country has at least one National Contact Point that can inform you whether or not you will be entitled to reimbursement, and whether any ceiling applies. The rules are different if you travel abroad specifically for medical treatment. FAQs FAQs - Unplanned healthcare: payments and reimbursements Need support from assistance services?

whether on holiday, a business trip or studying abroad - you are entitled to any medical treatment that can't wait until you get home. You have the same rights to health care as people insured in the country you are in. You should always take your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) with you on all trips abroad. This card is the proof that you are insured in an EU country. If you don't have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), or you can't use it (for instance, for private health care), you can't be refused treatment, but you might have to pay for your treatment upfront and claim reimbursement once you get home. Applying for the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) In some countries the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is issued together with the national health card. In other countries, you need to apply for it. You should not have to pay anything for your EHIC. You should get it for free from your health insurer before leaving home. Warning Some rogue websites ask you to pay to order your European Health Insurance Card with them. Never use these sites: instead contact your public health care provider directly. Make sure you check with your health insurer how far your health insurance covers your family members.

Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland are counted as EU countries for the purposes of EU social security coordination rules The EHIC will not help you with rescue and repatriation - if you need free transport back home after falling seriously ill or after having an accident while visiting another EU country, you will need separate insurance cover The EHIC does not cover you for private healthcare or the cost of planned treatment in another EU country Sample story Take out extra insurance for travel risks Sven, a Swedish national, went to France on a skiing trip. On the second day of his holiday he hurt his knee skiing downhill and had to be rescued off the mountain by French rescue services. When he got home, he received a large bill for the cost of his rescue. Sven had to pay the bill in full, as search and rescue costs are not covered by the European Health Insurance Card.

Make sure you understand which country's social security system should cover you. Find out more about social security cover abroad. If you're unsure about your rights and want to check before you get treatment, contact a National Contact Point for healthcare. There's at least one in each EU country, and they can tell you whether you will be entitled to reimbursement, and if there are any reimbursement ceilings . Special conditions apply to healthcare coverage if you are: Working in one country, living in another If you work in one EU country and live in another, you are entitled to medical treatment in both countries. Make sure you register in the country where you work and get an S1 form (former E106 form) from your health insurance authority. This form gives you the right to get healthcare in the country where you live. Based on your insurance, your family members are also entitled to medical treatment if they live in an EU country. However, if you are a cross-border commuter, living in one EU country and working in Denmark, Ireland, Croatia, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Iceland or Norway, your family is only entitled to medical treatment there in limited situations, such as for emergency treatment during their stay. Caring for sick children As a cross-border commuter, check with your health insurance authority if you take time off work to look after your sick child. If your child is insured together with your partner in the country where you live you might not be entitled to benefits. Posted abroad on a short assignment (less than 2 years) As a worker posted abroad on a short assignment (less than 2 years) you can stay insured in your home country (the country from which you have been posted). Make sure you request an S1 form (former E106 form) from your healthcare authority in your home country. This will entitle you and your family to healthcare during your stay. When you arrive in the country where you'll be working, give your S1 form to the healthcare authority. Working in more than one country If you work in more than one EU country, but carry out at least 25% of your professional activities (working time and/or income) in the country where you live, then you will usually be covered for healthcare in the country where you live. However, some special rules apply in situations where you are working for employers or are self-employed outside the country where you live. Find out more about social security abroad. A civil servant seconded abroad If you are a civil servant seconded abroad, you are entitled to medical treatment in the country where you live. You should request an S1 form (former E106 form) from your health insurance authority in the country which you'll be working. This will entitle you and your family to healthcare during your stay. When you arrive in the country where you'll be working, give your S1 form to the healthcare authority. A student, researcher or trainee abroad If you go to another EU country for your studies, research work, a work placement or vocational training, you must have comprehensive health insurance in your host country. If you are not employed, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) could be an option, if you are eligible. If you are employed in your host country, you will need to subscribe to a local healthcare scheme there. Warning Some PhD students may be considered resident workers and can be required to subscribe to the local healthcare scheme or take out private health insurance. If you are sent for a temporary period to a university or research institution in another EU country by your university or research institute of origin, then you will remain under your home healthcare scheme for the time you are posted. Before leaving, you should apply for the EHIC card, or for an S1 form (former E106 form). Check with your health insurance provider or with the National Contact Point in your home country whether they will cover the cost of your healthcare abroad for the full duration of your stay. If they do, administrative procedures can be simpler if you have a valid European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). However, some national health insurers will however only cover the costs of your healthcare in another EU country for a limited time. This is often the case for mature students (older than 28 or 30) and workers on training abroad. If this is the case for you, you will need to register for state healthcare in your host country or to take out private health insurance. Sample story Find out about social security rules in the country where you'll be staying Wim, a Belgian citizen, went to the Netherlands for his university degree. He took his European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) with him. Wim wanted to work part-time during his studies. However, he discovered that in the Netherlands anyone who has a job there has to take out the national basic healthcare insurance, which costs around EUR 1,100 a year. This also applies to people who already have a valid European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from another country. The cost of basic healthcare insurance made working part-time more costly than Wim had anticipated. A pensioner Healthcare in the country where you live If you receive a pension from the country where you live: you and your family are covered by that country's health insurance system \u2014 even if you are also receiving pensions from other countries. If you do not receive a pension or any other income from the country where you live: you and your family will receive medical treatment in the country where you live if you would be entitled to medical treatment in the country that pays your pension. Sample story Make sure you know which healthcare system covers you Nicolas lived in France and worked there for most of his career, except for a few years he spent in Italy working as a waiter when he was younger. When Nicolas retired, he moved to Italy. His pension is therefore made up of 2 parts: an Italian pension reflecting the years he worked in Italy and a French pension for the years he worked in France. As Nicolas lives in Italy AND receives an old age pension from Italy, Italy will cover his healthcare expenses. He is no longer part of the French system. You should request an S1 form (former E106 form) from your health insurance provider in the country you are moving from. When you arrive in your new country, give your S1 form to the relevant authority. This document establishes your right to full healthcare coverage in your country of residence. Healthcare in the country where you used to work In principle, you and your family are only fully entitled to medical treatment in the country where you live. However, if the country which pays your pension is one of the following, you and your family members are entitled to medical treatment both in the country which pays your pension and in the country where you now live: Austria Germany Netherlands Belgium Greece Poland Bulgaria Hungary Slovenia Cyprus Iceland Spain Czechia Liechtenstein Sweden France Luxembourg Switzerland Warning If you paid contributions in a country which is not in the list above, you will only be entitled to complete healthcare coverage in the country where you now live. Retired cross-border commuters If your most recent job was as a cross-border commuter \u2013 meaning you lived in one country but commuted to work in another \u2013 and you retired because of old age or invalidity, the following applies: Continuation of a treatment You can continue to receive a treatment that started in the country where you used to work even after you have retired. This also applies to your dependants if their treatment began in: Austria Greece Netherlands Belgium Hungary Poland Bulgaria Italy Portugal Cyprus Latvia Romania Czechia Liechtenstein Slovakia Estonia Lithuania Slovenia France Luxembourg Spain Germany Malta Switzerland To continue receiving a treatment that started in the country where you used to work, you must submit an S3 form to the health authorities in that country. Coverage in the country where you used to work and in the country where you live If you worked as a cross-border worker for at least 2 years during the 5 years prior to your retirement, you are entitled to healthcare both in the country where you live and in the country where you used to work. Both you and your dependants are entitled to healthcare in the country where you previously worked if both this country and the country where you now live are in this group: Austria Germany Spain Belgium Luxembourg France Portugal If you travel to the country where you used to work to access medical treatment there, and the authorities in that country are no longer responsible for your healthcare costs, you must submit an S3 form to them. You can get an S3 form from the healthcare authority responsible for your healthcare cover. Looking for a job If you're receiving unemployment benefits from one EU country and decide to move to another EU country to look for a job, you should get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) for yourself and your family members before moving abroad. However, the EHIC will only allow you and your family to access necessary medical treatment (e.g. emergency treatment) during the period you are receiving unemployment benefits. If you're not insured in any EU country and decide to move to another EU country to look for a job, the social security institutions will decide which system will cover you and you'll probably need to be covered for healthcare in the country you move to. Find out more about social security cover abroad. National healthcare systems differ greatly within Europe EU countries are free to establish their own rules on entitlement to benefits and healthcare services. To avoid potentially serious problems and misunderstandings, find out about the social security system in your host country or contact your National Contact Point. Sample story Get to know the social security system of your new country Susanne always worked in Germany and moved to Spain when she retired. When she became ill, she was assisted by a home-care service from a private company, as there is no public home-care insurance in Spain. Her German home-care insurance paid part of the costs, but Susanne's share of the costs was much higher than it would have been if she had stayed in Germany. This was due to the differences between the German and the Spanish benefits systems. Differences in assessing incapacity level If you claim an invalidity pension or incapacity benefit, each country you have worked in could insist on examining you separately. One country might assess you as seriously incapacitated, while another country may not consider you incapacitated at all. Find out more about invalidity pensions in Europe.

If you fulfil this requirement, you can apply for a permanent residence document, which confirms your right to live in the country where you now live permanently, without any conditions. This is different from the registration certificate which is compulsory in many countries. The permanent residence document is not compulsory. But it can be useful when dealing with the authorities or for administrative formalities. The authorities may no longer require you to prove that you have a job, sufficient resources, health insurance, and so on. Applying for a permanent residence document To get a document certifying your right of permanent residence, you must submit proof that you have been living legally in the country for 5 years. You need to send different supporting documents with your application, depending on your situation (employed, self-employed, jobseeker, pensioner, student). This could include: a valid registration certificate issued when you arrived in the host country evidence that you've been living in the country, such as utility bills and rental contracts evidence such as payslips, bank statements, tax returns that you've been working, studying, self-employed, self-sufficient or looking for work The authorities must issue the permanent residence document as soon as possible and cannot charge you more than nationals pay for their identity cards. If they do not, you can call on our assistance services. The document is automatically renewable without any condition or requirement. However, its validity may differ depending on the issuing country. Qualifying for permanent residence before 5 years In some specific cases, you may apply for permanent residence before 5 years. Check if you qualify. Losing the right of permanent residence You can lose your right to permanent residence if you live outside the country for more than 2 consecutive years. Permanent residence for your EU family members The same rights apply to your EU family members. They are also entitled to a permanent residence document in the country where they have resided with you legally for a continuous period of 5 years.

although in some countries they may have to report their presence upon arrival. After 3 months in your host country, your non-EU family members must register their residence with the relevant authorities (often the town hall or local police station). To obtain a residence card, they will need: a valid passport your registration certificate as an EU national or any other proof of your residence in the country proof of the family relationship with you (such as a marriage or birth certificate) for (grand)children, proof they are under 21 or dependent on you for (grand)parents, proof that they are dependent on you for other family members, proof that they are dependent on you or there are serious health ground requiring you to take personal care of them for unmarried partners, proof of a long-term or durable relationship with you Warning No other documents may be requested The authorities should make their decision to issue a residence card or not within 6 months. If they do not do so, you can call on our assistance services. In any case, your non-EU family members cannot be expelled if their visa expired while their application is being processed. If their application is rejected, the authorities must give them the decision in writing, stating the grounds for the decision and its implications, and specifying how your relatives/partner can appeal and by when. If their application is accepted, the residence card will often be issued free of charge. If fees are charged, they may not be more than those charged to nationals for similar documents, such as identity cards. The document should clearly state that it is the residence card of an EU national family member. The residence card should be valid for 5 years (or for your planned length of stay, if shorter). Any change of address may need to be reported to the authorities. Your family members may use their residence card to travel to another EU country but if they want to move to another EU country, they have to apply for another residence card in the new host country. And as long as they are dependent on you, you have to move with them. Sample story James is an American citizen living in Italy with his mother and his Italian stepfather, Giuseppe. James would like to move to Spain and look for a job. His parents cannot move with him but are in a position to support him financially. When applying for a residence card in Spain, the Spanish immigration authorities told James that although he has a residence permit in Italy as a family member of an EU citizen, this does not give him the automatic right to Spanish residency. His right to reside in the EU is dependent on Giuseppe's EU citizenship. Giuseppe would have to move with James to Spain and prove that he has sufficient economic resources for both of them.

If nationals are required to have lived in the country for a certain period to be allowed to stand for election in EU elections, the same conditions will apply to you. However, the periods that you have spent in other EU countries - other than your home country - should be taken into account to fulfil this requirement. Warning Special rules apply in Luxembourg because non-nationals make up more than 20% of the total electorate there. Luxembourg is therefore allowed to require a longer residence period before you can stand as a candidate there, which currently is 5 years.

residence rights As an EU national, you have the right to go and look for work in another EU country. If you have been working in another EU country and you lose your job, or if you are self-employed and you run out of work, you can keep your right to live there under certain conditions. Choose a situation: I moved to another EU country and I am looking for a job. I have already worked in my host EU country but I lost my job there. The first 6 months Reporting your presence As a jobseeker, you don't need to register as a resident for the first 6 months. But some EU countries require you to report your presence here to the relevant authorities within a reasonable period after arrival: often at the town hall or local police station. Registering with the employment services If you are being paid unemployment benefits from your home country, you will have to register with the employment service in your host country. You and your family will still be covered by the social security system in your home country, for instance for healthcare costs. Even if you don't receive unemployment benefits from your home country, you may still be covered by its social security system: check with the social security authority in your home country. While you're being covered by your home health insurance during your stay abroad, healthcare procedures may be simpler if you have a valid European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). Sample story No need to register your residence immediately Marta is Portuguese and moved to Spain 4 months ago to try to find a job there. At the moment, she is living at a friend's house. The Spanish police asked her to register her residence at the town hall and to prove she had sufficient means to support herself while in Spain. As a jobseeker, Marta is entitled to stay in Spain for at least 6 months without having to register her residence there. She only has to prove that she is a jobseeker who is actively looking for a job. The Spanish authorities cannot require her to demonstrate she can support herself financially. Still looking for a job after 6 months Assessment of your right to stay If you have not found a job during the first 6 months of your stay, the national authorities can assess your right to stay longer. For this, they will ask for evidence that you: are actively looking for a job and have a good chance of finding one Always keep copies of your job applications, responses from potential employers, invitations for interviews and so on. You are not required to register with the employment services in your new country unless you are receiving unemployment benefit from your home country. But if you do register, it will help you to prove that you are actively looking for a job. Can you be deported or asked to leave? Your host country can ask you to leave if you can't prove that you have a realistic chance of finding work there. In exceptional cases, your host country can deport you on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health - but only if it can prove you pose a serious threat. The deportation decision or request to leave must be given to you in writing. It must state all the reasons for your deportation and specify how you can appeal and by when. Equal treatment As a jobseeker, you are entitled to be treated in the same way as nationals of your host country with regard to: access to work support from employment services to find a job Your host country might wait until you have established a genuine link with the local job market before granting certain types of financial support to help you find work - such as low-interest loans for unemployed people to do training courses. Being in the country and looking for work for a reasonable amount of time may count as a genuine link. However, during your stay as a jobseeker, you don't have a right to non-contributory welfare benefits. If you have been working in another EU country and you lose your job, or if you are self-employed and you run out of work, you can keep your right to live there under certain conditions. How long you can stay will depend on how long you have been working in your new country and the type of contract you had before you lost your job. If you are temporarily unable to work as a result of an illness or accident, you can stay for as long as this condition lasts and prevents you from working. Equal treatment While you stay in your host country after losing your job, you should continue to enjoy the same rights as nationals of that country, including: welfare benefits (including unemployment benefit) access to employment assitance from public employment services Can you be requested to leave or be deported? In exceptional cases, your host country can deport you on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health - but only if it can prove you pose a serious threat. The deportation decision must be given to you in writing. It must state all the reasons for your deportation and specify how you can appeal and by when. Check your rights to stay according to your situation: I have worked in my host country for less than 1 year I have worked in my host country for more than 1 year I am following vocational training If you had a permanent contract or a fixed-term contract for less than 1 year and you lost your job before the end of the 1-year period, you have the right to stay in your host country for at least another 6 months, provided you are looking for work. The 6-month period starts from the moment your contract ends. You must register with the public employment service as involuntarily unemployed and look for work. Sample story You can stay abroad even if you lose your job Sabrina is a German national who went to Greece to work in a small hotel. She had a 9-month contract, but her employer decided to stop her contract after the first 4 months. After she registered as involuntarily unemployed with the Greek unemployment services, she was allowed to stay for another 6 months while she was looking for a new job. If you lose your job after having worked in your host country for more than 1 year, you have the right to continue to live there, provided you are registered as a jobseeker and continue to meet the conditions required to be considered as a jobseeker. To keep the right to stay in your host country when you lose your job or are not professionally active (self-employed), you must register as a job seeker with the employment service in your host country. You can stay as long as you are registered as a jobseeker with the public employment service and continue to meet the conditions required for jobseekers. If you become involuntarily unemployed and begin vocational training, you have the right to stay in your new country for the entire duration of your training. If you have become unemployed voluntarily, you have the right to stay in your host country for the whole duration of your training but only if that training is related to your previous employment. If it is not, you can stay in your new country under the same conditions as students. Read more about rights and conditions for students. To keep the right to stay in your new country for the whole duration of your vocational training, you must register as a jobseeker with the authorities in your host country. This also applies if you are voluntarily unemployed.

As an EU national, the entry documents required when travelling to the UK will differ according to whether you have a residence status in the UK under the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement (EU Settlement Scheme), or not. What is your situation? I am an EU national with UK Settled or Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme Travel to the UK If you have UK Settled or Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you can continue to enter the UK with a valid passport or identity card. Your non-EU family members who also have UK settled or pre-settled status can enter the UK with a valid passport. Warning As of 2026, the UK will no longer accept ID cards (as an entry document) that do not comply with applicable international standards related to biometric identification. Travel to an EU country As an EU national, you have the right to travel to any EU country with a valid passport or ID card. Your non-EU family members may need an entry visa, depending on their nationality. Read more about travelling in the EU with your non-EU family members and how to apply for a visa if they need one. Residence cards for non-EU family members previously issued by the UK under the EU rules on free movement are no longer valid. I am an EU national without any status under the UK's EU Settlement Scheme As a rule, the UK does not require a visa for short stays up to six months for tourism and business, check the rules that apply to your situation.

Non-EU family members of UK nationals covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, who would otherwise need a visa on the basis of their nationality, benefit from a visa exemption in their country of residence and other EU countries (see below) only if they hold a residence document. The information on travel documents provided here also applies to UK nationals and their family members residing in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (Schengen area countries). These countries have concluded their own separation agreements with the UK, which contain similar provisions on citizen's rights to those in the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. What is your situation? I am a UK national living in an EU country with residence rights under the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement Travel to my EU country of residence You will need a passport and a residence document issued by your EU country of residence. The same rules apply to your non-EU family members who are covered by the Withdrawal Agreement. In some EU countries, you are required to apply for a new residence status and will be issued with a new Withdrawal Agreement residence document in the form of a biometric residence card (you can find a sample here) which you must carry when travelling or if you do not yet have this card a certificate of application. We strongly recommend that you and your family members apply for the new biometric residence card even if you reside in an EU country where you do not have to apply for a new residence status, as this card will facilitate travel. Important information on residence documents issued under the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement The new biometric residence card for UK nationals and their family members residing in EU countries, under the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, is being gradually rolled out in 2021. Deadlines for applying for the new residence document differ from one country to another, and in some EU countries, you are not required to obtain a new residence document. Until your new biometric residence card is issued, you should generally continue to use your existing residence documents. If you have any doubt about whether you can continue using an existing residence document for travelling, please contact the authorities in the EU country that issued the document for advice. When travelling you should also bring your application for your new residence document. If, before 31 December 2020, the EU country where you live did not issue you with any residence document, you may be asked at the border to show some other evidence that you were living there in accordance with EU rules on or before 31 December 2020. In case of doubt, border guards will stamp your passport. Regardless of the deadlines, we advise you to apply for the new biometric residence card as soon as possible. In all EU countries, you are entitled to the new biometric residence card issued under the Withdrawal Agreement for UK nationals and their family members. In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, The Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia and Sweden it is necessary to apply for a new residence status. In these countries UK nationals and their family members will be required to apply for the new biometric residence card (issued under the Withdrawal Agreement) by a specific date. You will find the application deadlines here. Non-EU Family members travelling to another EU or Schengen area country When travelling to the following EU and Schengen area countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, the residence document issued to your family members by one of these countries will allow them to benefit from a visa exemption The residence document issued to your non-EU family member by one of the above EU and Schengen area countries will also allow them to benefit from a visa exemption when travelling to Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus or Romania. However, if your EU country of residence is Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus or Romania, the residence document issued to your family members does not exempt them from a visa for travel to the Schengen area countries. However, they may benefit from a visa exemption when travelling between Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus or Romania. Please contact the national authorities for more information. Warning Residence documents issued by Ireland do not allow your non-EU family members to benefit from a visa exemption when travelling to any EU or Schengen area country. I am a UK national without any status under the EU-UK Withdrawal agreement When travelling to the Schengen area, you are not required to have a short-stay visa (Schengen visa) when crossing the external borders, if your intended stay is up to a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period. If you are planning to carry out a paid activity during your stay in the Schengen area, you may have to apply for a short-stay visa. Please check with the relevant consular authorities in the country you are travelling to for more information.

Taxes (VAT and excise) are included in the price of the product in the country where you bought it, so no further payments are due in any other EU country. However, to determine if the products you have bought are for your own use, EU customs authorities can look at several different elements such as, if you own or work for a commercial business, how the goods are packaged and transported etc. They will also look at the quantity of products you are travelling with. Warning Be aware that each EU country can decide on a maximum amount of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages that you can bring into the country. These maximum amounts must be at least: 800 cigarettes 400 cigarillos (cigars weighing maximum 3 grams each) 200 cigars 1 kg of tobacco 10 litres of spirits 20 litres of fortified wine 90 litres of wine (including a maximum of 60 litres of sparkling wines) 110 litres of beer Carrying quantities above the limits If customs authorities suspect that you are carrying goods which are not for your own use, or are intended for resale, you may be asked to prove that they are (by producing proof of purchase etc.). If you cannot provide sufficient evidence, you might be asked to pay duties or your products could be confiscated. Warning Stricter rules apply to travellers under 17 years old. These can vary from country to country, so check before you travel. Carrying cash If you plan to enter or leave the EU with EUR 10 000 euros or more in cash (or the equivalent in other currencies) you must declare it to the customs authorities. Failure to do so could result in your cash being retained by the customs authorities, and you may receive a fine. Be aware that the customs authorities may carry out individual checks as well as checks on your baggage and/or vehicle. If you want to travel between EU countries with EUR 10 000 euros or more in cash (or the equivalent in other currencies), you must check with the customs authorities in the countries you are leaving, entering and passing through whether you must declare it. VAT and excise duties when entering the EU If you enter the EU from a non-EU country, you can bring goods free of VAT and excise duties with you within the limits set out below and if they are not for resale. The same rules apply if you come from the Canary Islands or other territories where EU rules on VAT and excise do not apply. Alcoholic drinks You can bring in: 4 litres of still wine and 16 litres of beer You can also bring: a total of 1 litre of spirits over 22 % vol. or 1 litre of undenatured alcohol (ethyl alcohol) of 80% vol. (or over) or 2 litres of fortified or sparkling wine Each of these amounts represents 100% of the total of this last allowance which you can split. For example, you can bring a half a litre of spirits and 1 litre of fortified wine - both represent half of this allowance. Tobacco products There is a higher or lower limit depending on the EU country you are visiting. If an EU country applies the lower limits, it can either apply them only to land and sea travellers (Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia) or to all travellers (Estonia and Romania). Higher limit Lower limit 200 cigarettes or 100 cigarillos or 50 cigars or 250 g tobacco 40 cigarettes or 20 cigarillos or 10 cigars or 50 g tobacco You may combine any of these tobacco products but you must not exceed the total limit. For example, 50 cigarillos + 25 cigars = total allowance. Warning If you are under 17 years old you are not entitled to a duty free allowance for tobacco or alcohol. Other goods including perfume You may carry other goods up to a value of EUR 300 per traveller or EUR 430 for travellers by air and sea.

This rule applies to any type of motorised vehicle. Excise duties when leaving the EU If you are travelling to a destination outside the EU (and certain areas within the EU such as the Canary Islands) you can buy goods free of duty and tax in so-called \"tax-free shops\" in airports and ports. You should however bear in mind that these goods may be subject to duty free and tax free allowances in your non-EU country of destination. Transiting in the EU via Switzerland or another non-EU country Warning If you travel from one EU country to another EU country via Switzerland Swiss customs rules apply. If you carry quantities of alcohol or tobacco above the thresholds allowed in Switzerland, you must declare them when you enter Switzerland and when you re-enter the EU. In Switzerland you may be requested to provide a financial guarantee which you will get back when you leave the country with the goods.

maximum capacity 1 litre - and no container may hold more than 100 ml. Liquid containers larger than 100 ml must be placed in checked baggage. The volume restriction does not apply to medicines and baby food. Duty free liquids purchased from any airport or airline may be carried as hand luggage as long as the item and the receipt remain sealed inside the security bag (with a red border) provided at the time of purchase. You may not open the security bag until arrival at your final destination. However, security officers may need to open the bag and the bottles for screening. If this happens, and you have a connecting flight at another airport, tell the security officer so the liquids can be re-sealed in a new security bag. Any sharp objects that might be used as weapons are not allowed in the aircraft cabin. These could be everyday objects such as corkscrews knives and scissors of a certain size, which should be packed in your hold luggage. Limits on the size of cabin baggage and the number of items you are allowed to take on board are set by the airlines so check with your airline before you travel. Explosives and inflammable items - fireworks or aerosol spray paint for example, and other inflammable and toxic substances such as acids - are prohibited on flights. They may not be carried in either cabin or checked baggage. No weapons of any kind are allowed on board the aircraft. See the rules on prohibited articles in your hand and hold luggage. Warning Check your airport's website for a detailed list of prohibited items or ask your airline before travelling. For general safety, all travel items are scanned or otherwise checked before being allowed into airport security zones. Need support from assistance services?

This includes: the right to clear information the right to a fair contract access to alternative dispute resolution in case of disputes with the rental company When you book a car, you should distinguish between rental companies and intermediaries or brokers. Intermediaries do not provide the rental car themselves, but book a car in your name with the rental company. In case of disputes, the rental company is the one responsible for the implementation of the contract, unless stated otherwise in the contract. Limited right to cancellation If you have booked a car online, by phone or email in the EU, you don't automatically have the right to cancel and claim a refund, although the car hire company's terms and conditions may allow it. Warning Car hire is not covered by EU rules entitling you to a 14-day \"cooling off\" period. Non-discrimination principle Car rental firms are free to set their own prices and conditions across different EU countries based on the costs they incur and other factors. However, when you hire a car \u2013 either online or directly from the premises of a car rental firm \u2013 EU rules ban discrimination on the grounds of nationality or the country where you live. Sample story Stefanie, from Germany, wanted to hire a car in Ireland. The price quoted on the car hire firm's website was EUR 70. But when Stefanie told the firm where she lived, the price shot up to over EUR 140. The reason given was that she was not an Irish resident. Feeling this was unfair, Stefanie contacted the European Consumer Centre, which got the car rental firm to bring its policy in line with EU rules. Look before you book! Make sure you understand the terms and conditions before hiring a car. The main things to look out for are: Insurance cover Every rental vehicle needs to be covered by the third party liability insurance, which is valid in all EU countries. This insurance should be included in the rental price. You can also take out optional insurance, covering other risks, e.g. injuries to the driver, damage to your vehicle, theft of your vehicle/its contents, vandalism, and legal assistance. Make sure you know what damage your insurance contract covers. You should find this in the terms and conditions of the rental contract. Driving a hired car in another country If you're planning to drive your rental vehicle in several countries you must inform the rental company when booking the vehicle. If it allows you to take the vehicle to another country than the visited one, it can ensure you have the correct vehicle documentation, insurance and breakdown cover. If you live in the EU and you rent a car in a non-EU country, such as Switzerland, special rules apply when driving it in EU countries. If you plan to travel with your rental car both in EU and non-EU countries \u2013 for example from Switzerland to France, Germany, Austria or Italy \u2013 you need to tell the rental company in advance. They can provide you with an EU-registered car in order to comply with EU customs laws. Most car rental companies in Switzerland provide cars with EU number plates for EU residents in order to comply with EU customs rules, but you should check with your car rental company. The car rental company must also ensure that the car complies with the customs and traffic rules of the country where you will travel. For example, in many countries winter tyres are compulsory during certain months of the year. Check road safety information when driving in another EU country. Driving licence validity If you are planning to rent and drive a car in another EU country, you also need to check that your driving licence is valid there.

Driving licence recognition and validity EU driving licences If your licence was issued in an EU country, you can use it anywhere in the EU. Before you travel abroad, make sure your driving licence is still valid. If your driving licence expires during a trip abroad, it automatically becomes invalid and may not be recognised in other countries. Be aware that you cannot drive in another country on a provisional driving licence or certificate. Standard format Since 2013, all driving licences issued in the EU have a standard format \u2013 a plastic, credit card-sized photocard, with better security features. You can still use your old-style licence, but it will be changed to the new format when you renew it (or at the latest by 2033). The following categories of driving licence are recognised throughout Europe: AM, A1, A2, A, B, BE, B1, C1, C1E, C, CE, D1, D1E, D and DE. Warning Teenagers: be aware in some EU countries different age restrictions apply for certain categories of vehicle. Sample story Sofia is 14 and got her moped licence in Italy. She would like to drive a moped in Belgium, but the minimum driving age for mopeds is 16. Sofia will have to wait until she is 16 before she can legally drive her moped in Belgium without having to pass a Belgian driving test. EU driving licences issued in exchange for a non\u2011EU licence If you have exchanged your non\u2011EU licence for an EU licence in the country where you now live, you can drive with it throughout the EU. Non-EU driving licences If you want to drive in the EU on a licence issued in a country outside the EU, contact the authorities of the country you are visiting, or your embassy or consulate in that country. Lost or stolen driving licence If your driving licence is lost or stolen while you are travelling abroad, contact the local police and your consulate or embassy to report the matter. Your consulate will contact the national authorities that issued your driving licence (to check it was not restricted, suspended, cancelled or revoked). On the basis of the information received from the consulate, the police may then issue a provisional document that allows you to drive in that country for a limited period of time. You can only apply for a replacement driving licence in the country where you have your usual residence. Provisional licences and certificates issued to temporarily replace lost or stolen licences are not automatically recognised in other EU countries. Sample story Henrik, lives in Denmark and planned to visit Germany, France and Italy on his holidays. Unfortunately, he lost his wallet and driving licence in Germany at the start of his trip. Without a licence, he could be fined if stopped by the police. Henrik contacted the Danish embassy in Germany, who advised him to report the loss to the local police. The Danish embassy also gave him a certificate stating that he is the legal holder of a Danish driving licence. Henrik then had to contact the Italian and French authorities to check that they would recognise the provisional certificate issued by the Danish authorities. Have you lost your driving licence while on holiday? More information on what to do: Questions on a specific country? Search terms Find out more about driving licences when living abroad. Car insurance validity Your car insurance policy issued in home country covers you throughout the EU if you injure someone? Find out more information about national regulations concerning insurance cover when travelling abroad. Questions on a specific country? Search terms Your car's number plate is proof that you have liability insurance. This means that police in another country will not normally stop you to check if you are insured. If you travel with a trailer, it needs to be insured too. In some EU countries you must have separate insurance for a trailer. Check with your insurer before you travel. Always take your insurance papers with you. It may make things easier if you have an accident or are stopped by the police. Sample story Ronaldo was stopped for speeding in France. Because he did not have his insurance documents with him, the police asked him to call his insurer in Portugal to prove he was insured. Even though you aren't legally obliged to, carrying your papers with you is the best way to prove you are covered. It can save you time and money if you run into problems abroad.

Even if you don't need a passport for border checks within the Schengen area , it is still always highly recommended to take a passport or ID card with you, so you can prove your identity if needed (if stopped by police, boarding a plane, etc.). Schengen EU countries have the possibility of adopting national rules obliging you to hold or carry papers and documents when you are present on their territory. Driving licences, post, bank or tax cards are not accepted as valid travel documents or proof of identity. Warning Under Schengen rules, in extenuating circumstances, where a threat to public policy or national security has been identified Member States are permitted to reintroduce temporary border controls. More detailed information and the list of countries which have temporarily reintroduced border controls. Ensure that you have either your ID or passport in your possession when travelling to these countries. Also bear in mind that even under normal circumstances you may be required to produce one of these documents. The border-free Schengen area includes: Non-Schengen area includes: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, Romania. When travelling to or from a non-Schengen country you must show a valid ID or passport. Before travelling, check what documents you must have to travel outside your home country and to enter the non-Schengen country you plan to visit. Sample story Lars is Swedish and holidaying in Spain. He took his ID card issued by a bank with him - in Sweden, it's accepted as proof of identity. But Lars could get into trouble if the Spanish authorities want to check his identity, because the only valid ID documents they recognise are national ID cards and passports issued by the Swedish authorities. What is a valid ID card/passport in your country? Entry refusal In very rare cases, an EU country can refuse entry to you or your family members for reasons of \" public policy, public security or public health\". This means the authorities must prove you or your family members pose a \" genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat\". You are entitled to receive this decision in writing, stating all the grounds, and specifying how you can appeal and by when.

If you have moved to another EU country, they can also join you there. These rules also apply to your non-EU registered partner if the country they are travelling to considers registered partnerships as equivalent to marriage. Other non-EU extended family members - such as siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, as well as your non-EU registered partner (in countries where registered partnerships are not considered as equivalent to marriage) - may under certain conditions be entitled to have their entry facilitated when travelling together with you of when joining you in another EU country. EU countries do not automatically have to grant this right but they do at least have to consider the request. Your non-EU family members must carry a valid passport at all times and, depending on the country they are from, they may also have to show an entry visa at the border. There are a number of countries (see Annex II) whose nationals do not need a visa to visit the EU for three months or less. The list of countries whose nationals require visas to travel to Ireland differs slightly from other EU countries. Contact the consulate or embassy of the country you are travelling to well in advance to find out which documents your non-EU family member will be asked to present at the border.

If this is not clear they may be issued with the wrong type of visa for which they will be charged. Visa application - supporting documents Your non-EU family member must include the following documents with their visa application: a valid passport \u2013 to prove their identity and nationality a document proving family ties with the EU citizen (e.g. marriage certificate, birth certificate etc.) and dependency (if required) proof that the EU citizen is already living in the host country (if they are joining them) a declaration that the couple will travel together (if the family member will be accompanying the EU citizen) This list is exhaustive: your non-EU family members cannot be required to produce any other documents to support their application. (Visas issued by a country belonging to the border-free Schengen area are valid for all countries in that area.) Warning If you live outside the EU and your non-EU family members accompany you or travel to the EU country of your nationality, EU cross-border rules do not necessarily apply and your non-EU family members might be charged visa fees. Arriving at the border without an entry visa It is always best for your non-EU family members to be well-informed in advance and to have all the necessary documents before starting their journey. However, if they arrive at the border with their passport but without an entry visa, the border authorities should give them the opportunity to prove by other means that they are family members of a mobile EU citizen. They can do so by providing proof of their identity and family ties with an EU citizen (for example a marriage or birth certificate) and, proof that they are joining or accompanying the EU citizen (for example, proof that the EU citizen is already living in the country where entry is sought). If they manage to prove it, they should be issued with an entry visa on the spot. If your family members are having difficulties getting a visa, you can contact our assistance services. Entry refusal In very rare cases, an EU country can refuse entry to you or your family members for reasons of \"public policy, public security or public health\". If this happens, the authorities must prove that you or your family members pose a \"genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat\". You are entitled to receive this decision in writing, stating all the grounds, and specifying how you can appeal and by when.

You should apply for a visa from the consulate or embassy of the country you are visiting. If your visa is from a Schengen area country, it automatically allows you to travel to the other Schengen countries as well. If you have a valid residence permit from one of those Schengen countries, it is equivalent to a visa. You may need a national visa to visit non-Schengen countries. Border officials in EU countries may ask for other supporting documents such as an invitation letter, proof of lodging, return or round-trip ticket. For the precise requirements contact the local consular services of the EU country in question. There are a number of countries whose nationals do not need a visa to visit the EU for three months or less. The list of countries whose nationals require visas to travel to Ireland differs slightly from other EU countries. Warning Entry conditions to Ireland are based on national law and differ from EU rules. Other documents Do not forget your travel, health and/or car insurance documents.

There are no EU rules on this matter, each EU country decides if it requires the child to have an official authorisation from their parent(s) or guardian.

Still have questions?

Warning When travelling by air it is highly recommended that you check with the airlines before departing as many require official authorisations and have their own specific forms for this purpose. As each country's rules may change without notice you are also encouraged to check with the authorities themselves or with the respective embassies or consulates.

If you buy a package, you have well-defined rights before and throughout the booking process, and up until your holiday ends, for example the right to pre-contractual information, the organiser's liability for the proper performance of travel services included in your package and insolvency protection. These rights apply to packages purchased online or face-to-face, from a tour operator, travel agent, or any other trader that is acting as the organiser of the package. More limited rights apply to so-called \"linked travel arrangements\" (LTAs). Warning These rules do not cover stand-alone travel services (such as a flight or accommodation which are booked separately), certain types of business travel, packages sold on the basis of a framework agreement on an occasional, not-for-profit basis to a limited group of travellers, as well as packages lasting less than 24 hours unless they include accommodation. Package travel \u2013 different types of packages give you the same rights When you book a package holiday, you buy a combination of two or more different types of travel services for the same trip or holiday. These services can include transport, accommodation, car hire, or under specific conditions any other tourist service. Your package may be pre-arranged \u2013 consisting of a number of services combined by a tour operator or travel agent \u2013 or you may have a more customised package by choosing the services yourself before the contract is concluded. In both cases, EU rules apply as long as your travel package was purchased in a certain way. What is package travel? Your travel is considered as a package when: 1. You book travel services put together by or with the help of a trader, such as a tour operator or an online or offline travel agency under a single contract or 2. You book travel services under separate contracts with individual providers and one of the following conditions is met: you buy services at a single point of sale (such as a travel agency, a call centre or a website) and you select the services before agreeing to pay, i.e. before you conclude the first contract. This is the case, for example, where different travel services are put into a shopping basket or are otherwise selected before a contract is concluded. the services are sold to you at an inclusive or total price the services were advertised/sold as a \"package\" or similar travel services are combined after the conclusion of a contract under which you are entitled to choose from a selection of different travel services, for example a travel package gift box Click-through package: you buy services from separate travel companies through a linked online booking process where the first company transmits your name, email address and payment details to the second company and the second contract is concluded within 24 hours of the first contract A combination of a travel service, such as accommodation, and another tourist service, such as a guided tour, admission to a concert or sports event, or rental of sports equipment, can only be classed as a package if the other tourist service accounts for 25% or more of the overall value of the trip, or if that service is an essential feature of the trip. Sample story Booking a package travel holiday Michel from Belgium decided to organise his summer holiday through an online travel agency. The package he selected, a 2-week holiday in Italy, included flights, hotel accommodation and a number of day trips. As the total price for this all-inclusive package was very attractive, Michel decided to book his holiday. He finalised the booking, signed the contract and paid for his holiday via the online travel agency. Package travel \u2013 your right to clear and accurate information Before you book a package, the point of sale (booking website or app for example) or your travel agent must give you all the standard information about the package, such as the: travel destination (itinerary, dates and duration of the stay, details of any transfers, visits or excursions) and a list of services included name and contact details of the organiser of the package and, where it is sold through a retailer, of the retailer total price, inclusive of all taxes and where applicable all additional fees, and the payment arrangements information on how to terminate the contract before the start of the package on payment of an appropriate termination fee information on passport and visa requirements information on complaint-handling procedures, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms and, where appropriate, the ADR entity, and the online dispute resolution platform You should also receive clear information on your rights, based on an EU standardised form, explaining that you have been offered a package and outlining your rights. Package travel - changes to or termination of the contract Price increase: The organiser may increase the price of the package only if specific costs rise (for example, fuel prices). This must be clearly explained in the contract and cannot be applied any later than 20 days before the start of the package. If the price increase is more than 8% of the total price of the package, you have the right to end the package contract without a termination fee. If you cannot travel you may: Transfer the package to another person: under certain conditions, you can transfer your package to another person, although you can be charged a reasonable fee for this, up to the actual cost incurred by the organiser to transfer your package travel contract. Terminate the contract: the organiser may however deduct a reasonable fee from your refund, depending, in particular, on the timing of your cancellation. These rights are independent of any rights you may have under a cancellation insurance policy that you have taken out. Cancellation by the organiser: Under normal conditions, if the organiser cancels the sale before the start of your package, you are entitled to a refund and compensation, where appropriate. Cancellation in exceptional circumstances: If a natural disaster occurs or if there are serious security problems at your holiday destination that are likely to affect the package, the organiser may cancel the package. As a traveller, you are also free to cancel your package free of charge for the same reasons. In these cases, you are entitled to a full refund of any payments you've made but you are not entitled to additional compensation. Warning Because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers offer vouchers that you can redeem later as an alternative to reimbursement. However, as a customer, you have the choice to request a cash reimbursement. Package travel \u2013 liability for proper performance of travel services The organiser is responsible for the proper performance of all travel services included in your package. If a travel service can't be provided as agreed, for example if a provider can't carry out an agreed service or can't do so in the agreed form (such as providing transport to or from your destination, providing the agreed type of accommodation, or carrying out a guided tour that you booked), the organiser has to resolve the problem at no extra cost to you. If it is impossible to make alternative arrangements or you reject the arrangements offered to you on valid grounds, and the package includes your transport (such as air travel), the organiser must offer to repatriate you. If the travel services do not reach the agreed standards and this cannot be resolved on the spot, you may also be entitled to compensation. Package travel - assistance to travellers If you get into difficulty during your package holiday, for example if you have health problems or lose your passport, the organiser has to give you assistance, such as information on health services or on consular assistance, and should help you find alternative travel arrangements if necessary. Linked travel arrangements Linked travel arrangements (LTAs) are two or more travel services you buy from different traders in separate contracts, but the services are linked. They are classed as linked travel arrangements when one trader facilities the booking of the subsequent services, and they are bought for the same trip or holiday. Linked travel arrangements only apply if the combination of travel services does not constitute a package (see above) and a trader facilitates: your bookings on the basis of a single visit or contact with his/her point of sale, e.g. during a single visit to a travel agent or website or a second booking you make for a second travel service, in response to a targeted invitation, for example by email or web link, and you conclude a contract for the second travel service with another supplier within 24 hours of receiving confirmation of the booking of the first travel service A combination of a travel service such as accommodation and another tourist service, such as a guided tour or admission to a concert, can only be classed as a linked travel arrangement if the additional service accounts for 25% or more of the overall value of the trip, or that service is an essential feature of the trip. Sample story Booking linked travel arrangements Laura from Italy booked and paid for a flight for her holiday to Ireland directly with an airline. Shortly after receiving email confirmation for her flight, she got an email with a link to a hotel chain in Ireland offering a good deal for her stay in Ireland. Laura decided to take up this offer and concluded a contract with the hotel chain the same day. Linked travel arrangements \u2013 clear and accurate information The trader facilitating your linked travel arrangement must give you clear information on your rights, based on a standardised EU form, explaining that you have been offered a linked travel arrangement (not a package) and outlining your rights. Liability for booking errors These rules apply to packages and LTAs. When you book a holiday, the responsible trader (the travel agent or online travel agency) is liable if any of the following occurs during the booking process: technical defects in the booking system errors made by the retailer if they are responsible for arranging the booking of a package or of travel services which are part of linked travel arrangements Traders are not responsible for any booking errors made by you, or problems which are deemed unavoidable or are due to extraordinary circumstances. Protection in case of bankruptcy These rules apply to package travel and LTAs. If the trader you booked your holiday with goes bankrupt, you are protected by insolvency protection. This can be a fund, an insurance or any other mechanism in place in your EU country. This will refund any payments you may have made and will, if required, repatriate you if transport was included in your package or LTA.

can be quite a minefield. The same is true of joining a long-term holiday scheme, such as a discount holiday club, which gives the right to discounts on accommodation or related benefits, sometimes in combination with travel or other services, for more than one year. Both conventional timeshares and the various long-term holiday schemes which have emerged over the years can involve a substantial long-term or permanent financial commitment. They also entail additional recurring costs (e.g. taxes, maintenance and insurance). Contractual terms - your rights The most recent EU rules, give you protection against unscrupulous traders when signing contracts for timeshares or long-term holiday schemes. These rules\u00a0apply to contracts concluded as of 23 February 2011 (or later in some EU countries). The rules also protect you when signing: resale contracts (you pay a professional to help you sell or buy a timeshare or holiday club membership) exchange contracts (you pay to join a scheme allowing you to use accommodation or other services, while also allowing others to make temporary use of your own timeshare). Your rights extend to different types of timeshare property including: cruise boats caravans canal boats What you should know before buying Before you decide to go ahead, be aware of your rights which include: Being informed in\u00a0full of the terms of the agreement before you sign. You must be given the details in writing in your own language (if it is an official EU language). A cooling-off period of 14 calendar days during which you can decide to withdraw from the contract without giving any reason. If you do not receive the standard withdrawal form required by the EU rules, this cooling-off period is extended to 1 year and 14 calendar days. An extension of the cooling-off period to 3 months and 14 calendar days if you do not receive full information about the product you are buying. The seller can never ask you to make an advance payment or a deposit during the cooling-off period. When buying holiday club membership, payment must be made in equal instalments at yearly intervals. You also have the right to terminate\u00a0the holiday club contract, without incurring any penalty, from the second instalment onwards. Once you receive the request for the next payment, you have 14 calendar days to give notice of termination to the trader. If you have also signed a linked exchange contract, this is also automatically terminated - at no cost to you - if you withdraw from the timeshare contract. If, under a resale contract, you have employed a professional to help you sell your timeshare or holiday club membership, this\u00a0professional cannot take any payment from you until your timeshare has been sold or the resale contract is otherwise terminated. Warning If your contract is a timeshare or long-term holiday scheme contract, you are covered by these rules even if the seller claims that they are not applicable. Unfair commercial practices and potentially unfair contractual terms Other things to be aware of include: unlawful misleading sales techniques such as the \"winning scratch card\" ploy: you win a prize and are taken to collect it to a timeshare sales event where you are pressed into signing a contract suspicious timeshare resale offers, especially where you are persuaded to buy another property with the promise of selling the existing one: in these cases you could end up with 2 timeshare properties that you neither want or need! suspicious offers\u00a0from people claiming to be lawyers in another EU country to represent you, for a fee, in that country's\u00a0courts, in your dispute with the seller suspicious offers from people pretending to be able to \"reclaim\", for a fee, your payments to the timeshare seller your timeshare seller (resort) may not unduly limit your right to privately sell, rent out or exchange your timeshare rights;\u00a0or restrict your access to services; or raise maintenance payments without justification. If he does so based on the standard terms of your contract, these terms may be breaking the Unfair Contract Terms rules and therefore may not be binding on you. consider the long-term, or even everlasting, effect of committing to a timeshare. Think carefully whether you will still want/be able to use it in some 10 or 20 years. Will your children, who may inherit your timeshare and be obliged to keep up the maintenance payments, want to use it? For advice on problems in the country where you live contact your national consumer organisation, in case of a dispute with a seller in another EU country, contact the European Consumer Centre Network (ECC-Net) to find out about your rights and the protection you are entitled to. You can also\u00a0try to settle your dispute out-of-court using an alternative dispute resolution procedure. If you bought your timeshare or long-term holiday contract online, you can also submit your complaint online via the ODR platform. Sample story Timeshare contract cancellation: citizen vs trader Patrick from Ireland signed a timeshare contract with a provider in Malta in 2013. The trader did not give him the standard withdrawal form or inform him that no advance payments or deposits could be accepted during the cooling-off period. He paid a deposit of EUR 1 260 and set up a direct debit charge of EUR 122.50 per month for 2 years. To book a holiday in one of the trader's properties, he needed a special code number from the trader, but despite repeated requests this was never supplied. One year on, he was still unable to book any holidays so he chose to withdraw from the contract, relying on the rules extending the withdrawal period to 1 year and 14 calendar days. By this stage he had paid EUR 2 730. The trader would not accept the withdrawal or refund Patrick's money. Having sought advice from ECC Ireland, Patrick took legal action through the European Small Claims procedure, and the court ruled in his favour. Yet the trader still did not pay up. Following intervention by ECC Malta, Patrick finally got his money back.

At the very latest, you must inform the carrier within 15 days of disembarking the ship or delivery of your luggage, otherwise you lose your right to compensation. You must bring your claim to the courts within 2 years from the date of disembarkation or 2 years from the date when disembarkation should have taken place - whichever date is later. You can submit a claim for compensation for any loss or damage caused by an incident at sea to a court in the country: where the carrier has its main place of business or permanent residence, or of your place of departure or destination is, or where you permanently live \u2013 if the carrier has a place of business there and is subject to that country's jurisdiction, or where the travel contract was concluded \u2013 if the carrier has a place of business there and is subject to that country's jurisdiction See also Transport and disability Rights for travellers with disabilities or reduced mobility FAQs FAQs - Ship passenger rights EU legislation Rights of passengers travelling by sea and inland waterway EU Regulation on the liability of carriers of passenger by sea in the event of incidents Affected by Brexit?

It is up to each EU country to decide whether to use these, but if a country has chosen this option it must comply with EU rules. If you are asked to undergo screening by such a scanner you should know, in particular, that: you must be given the possibility of opting out from a body scanner. In this case you will be screened by an alternative method including at least a hand search; you must be given full information on the technology used before you are screened; you can ask that the image of your body is analysed by a human reviewer of the gender of your choice; the human reviewer will be somewhere else and will not be able to see you; the image will be blurred so you cannot be identified and the images cannot be copied, stored or printed; only scanners which do not use ionizing radiation can be used.

It will get you straight through to the emergency services \u2013 police, ambulance, fire brigade. National emergency numbers are still in use too, alongside 112. But 112 is the only number you can use to access the emergency services in all EU countries. Sample story Preventing a disaster Anasthassios from Greece had a fire in his apartment in Lisbon just after moving there to study. He didn't know the Portuguese emergency services number, but he remembered he could use the 112 emergency number in Portugal, just as in his native Greece or anywhere in the EU. So he dialled 112 and got straight through to Lisbon emergency services which sent the fire brigade to his home straight away. When you're travelling in the EU, remember to take your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) with you. If you need emergency medical care, the EHIC card will simplify the paperwork and help you get refunded for any public health care expenses. 116 000: missing children If your child goes missing, whether at home or in another EU country, you can call 116 000, the hotline for missing children. The 116 000 hotline is currently available in all 27\u200b\u00a0EU countries. You can use the hotline to report a missing child; it also provides guidance and support to the families of missing children. Sample story How to report a missing child On holiday in France, Andreas and Kirsten, a couple from Germany were distraught when their daughter went missing while on an excursion. Some hours later they still hadn't found her. They reported the case to the police but also remembered the number available in Germany for reporting cases of missing children. Knowing that the 116 000 hotline worked in France too, they dialled the number and got advice on how to handle their case with the French authorities.

You can also activate eCall manually by pushing a button. How eCall works Your eCall system works in all EU countries. Wherever you are, if your vehicle is involved in a serious accident, you will be connected with the nearest emergency-response network. It doesn't matter where you bought your vehicle or where it is registered. When eCall is activated, it connects to the nearest emergency response centre, using both a telephone and data link. This allows you and the passengers in the vehicle to communicate with the emergency centre operator and at the same time, a minimum set of data is automatically transmitted (your exact location, the time of the accident, your vehicle's identification number and direction of travel). This allows the emergency services to assess and manage your situation. If the eCall system fails, you'll get a warning indication. Warning Information is only transmitted from your car in the event of a serious accident. eCall services offered by third parties Under EU rules you have the right to use a third party service (TPS) eCall system in addition to the standard 112-based one. These additional services could for example include roadside assistance. You may need to pay for any additional services provided by a TPS, unlike the free 112-based e-Call. Any TPS eCall system must: comply with EU approved technical standards ensure an automatic switch to the 112 eCall if the TPS does not work allow the owner of the vehicle to choose between the 112-based eCall and the TPS service not allow any exchange of data to take place with the 112 eCall system Warning If you have additional services provided through a TPS eCall system you must give your explicit consent to enable the traceability, tracking and processing of your personal data in this context. Compulsory for new car models If you buy a new model of car, approved for manufacture after 31 March 2018, it must have the 112-based eCall system installed. This rule applies both to cars with no more than 8 seats and light commercial vehicles. If you have a car which is already registered, you are not obliged to retrofit an eCall device but you can have it installed if your car meets the technical requirements. eCall privacy and the protection of your personal data Your eCall system is only activated if your vehicle is involved in a serious accident. The rest of the time the system remains inactive. This means that when you are simply driving your vehicle, no tracking (registering your car's position or monitoring your driving) or transmission of data takes place. When a call is made through your 112-based eCall system, your personal data is processed according to EU data protection rules. This means that the emergency services only receive the limited data they need to deal with the accident situation, your data is not stored for any longer than necessary, and is removed when no longer required.

Your right to legal protection Your rights when buying a car abroad \u2013 including the amount of VAT you have to pay \u2013 vary depending on whether: the car is new or used you are buying it from a professional car dealer or a private individual the seller is based in an EU country or not You generally have the greatest level of legal protection when you buy a new car from a professional seller based in the EU. Under EU consumer rights rules, you have a minimum of 2 years' guarantee if the car you purchased turns out to be faulty or not as advertised. In some EU countries, the guarantee period may be reduced to no less than 1 year for used vehicles. The buyer and seller have to agree to this at the time of purchase. Be aware that EU consumer rights do not apply to private sales, so you should be extremely cautious when buying a car from a private individual. Check the car documents When you buy a car abroad, make sure the seller gives you all the documents you need to register the car in the country where you live. Check that you have the original documents for the car. Transport your newly purchased car When you buy a new car in another EU country, you will need to consider carefully how to transport it home, as it will not yet be registered in the country where you live: You can tow the car home, hitching it to a fully insured and registered vehicle You can hire a specialised shipping company You can drive the car home yourself - for this you will need to get insurance and temporary number plates in the country where you buy the car Warning Make sure your insurance is valid and the plates recognised in all the countries you will drive through. As temporary number plates are not harmonised in the EU, you could find it difficult to obtain them or get them recognised by another EU country. Check with the relevant car insurance and registration authorities. You should obtain your car's permanent number plate in the country where you register your car, which is usually the country where you live or have your permanent residence. Sample story Irina bought a car in Germany and wanted to drive it home to Deva in Romania. The seller helped her get the temporary number plates and insurance valid for the 4 countries she would cross. Unfortunately, in Hungary the police stopped her saying she was not entitled to drive the car through Hungary with those plates. In fact, the yellow plates she had were only valid in Germany. She received a fine and the plates were confiscated. In the end, she had to hire a transport company to take the car to Romania. Moving abroad with a leased car Be aware this might be difficult. When you lease a car, you can use it for the duration of the lease and have the option to buy the car at the end of the contract. However, before that the person or company leasing the car to you is the car's legal owner. As you have to insure and register the car in your country of residence, you may also encounter problems if your insurance is not valid in the country you want to move to. The person or company leasing the car to you may also be reluctant to agree to you registering the car in another EU country. Sample story Zoltan took a new job in Germany and moved there with his family and took his leased car. After 6 months he found out he had to register the car in Germany so he could keep driving it there. As the lease still had another 3 months to run, the leasing company, a Hungarian bank, did not agree to de-register the car in Hungary. In the end, Zoltan had to end the contract with the bank early and pay the additional fees. For more detailed advice check the ECC-net recommendations on cross-border car purchases. Check also the rules on vehicle inspection, seller responsibilities, contract of sale, temporary plates or who to contact in case of disputes or fraud in your country of purchase: Choose country: Austriaaten Belgium*be Bulgaria*bg Croatia*cr Cyprus*cy Czechia*cz Denmark*dk Estoniaeeen Finlandfien Francefrfr Germany*de Greecegren Hungaryhuen Irelandieen Italy*it Latvia*lv Lithuanialten Luxembourgluen Maltamten Netherlandsnlen Norwaynoen Poland*pl Portugal*pt Romania*ro Slovakiasken Sloveniasien Spainesen Swedenseen * Information not yet available.

This applies regardless of whether you own the company or work for it, as long as the car was bought in the name of the company. Driving your company car abroad Less than 6 months If your work involves travelling regularly between different EU countries, be aware that you may be stopped for a police check. The police may ask for a copy of your contract of employment or evidence of the work you are carrying out in that particular EU country, especially if you are driving at night or during weekends. Sample story Andrea works as a salesman for an Italian company. Part of his job is to promote the company's products in Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. He regularly drives his Italian company car to these countries for work. The Romanian police often stop him to check that he is lawfully driving an Italian registered car in Romania. That is why he always carries with him in the car his employment contract and authorisation from his company to drive the car for business purposes outside Italy. More than 6 months In some countries, you can apply for an exemption from the registration rule in order to drive a company car in that country for more than 6 months. Check in advance with the competent national authority if this is possible. Sample story Marco works for a Finnish company. The company decides to send him to Portugal for a 1-year assignment. He will need to use his Finnish company car while in Portugal. In order to drive the car with Finnish plates in Portugal for more than 6 months, he has to apply with the Portuguese authorities for a special authorisation, known as the \"Guia de Circulac\u0327a\u0303o\". Once he has this authorisation from the Portuguese authorities, he will be able to drive his Finnish-registered car in Portugal for the period of his assignment. As a cross-border worker in the EU If you are a cross-border worker, meaning that you work in one country but live in a bordering country, and return home at least once a week, you may drive your company car in the country where you live without having to register it there if you drive it: between your place of work and home OR mainly for work purposes Sample story Jacob moved to the Netherlands a year ago but he continues to run his dental clinic in Belgium. During a standard vehicle check on the road the Dutch police found out that he had been living in the Netherlands. The police fined him and ordered him to register his car in the Netherlands. Jacob appealed the police decision and explained that his car was specifically purchased for his business activity (which he proved by providing invoices) and is registered in Belgium in the name of his company, and furthermore he predominately uses his car for professional purposes in the Netherlands. When the Dutch authorities verified the documents the fine was withdrawn. As a cross-border worker outside the EU If the company is based in a country outside the EU, there is no flexibility regarding the use of the company car for private journeys. You can only use your company car registered outside the EU to drive between your home and your place of work and to carry out any work-related activities in the EU. Any activities that you have to carry out in the EU must be mentioned in your contract of employment. In all other cases, the company may have to pay import duties on the car. Sample story Diana lives in France but works in Switzerland for a Swiss company. One Sunday, while driving her car, she was stopped by the French police. The police told her that she could only use her Swiss-registered company car in France to go to or return from her work, or to carry out any work-related activities in France. As Switzerland is not part of the EU, Diana needs to prove that she is using her company car for work purposes in France. Otherwise, her company may have to pay import taxes on the car. Private use of your company car If you want to use your company car for private as well as work purposes, this has to be clearly stated in your employment contract. Warning Be aware that a company car should be used mainly for work or professional purposes and only occasionally for private reasons. Sample story Magda lives in the Czech Republic and works in Slovakia. She drives a Slovak-registered company car mainly in Slovakia and from her place of work to her home town. She has agreed with her company that she can also drive the car occasionally for private purposes in the Czech Republic. She can do that as long as this arrangement is clearly provided for in her contract of employment. This should avoid her having any problems with the Czech police. Lending your company car When you use your company car temporarily in another EU country, you should not lend or rent this car to another person, e.g. your spouse or children. In some countries there may be exceptions to this rule, as long as the use of the car by another person is mentioned in the contract of employment. Check in advance with the relevant national registration authority. Questions on a specific country?

The information on this page covers VAT rules when buying or selling a car as a private person, it does not deal with business to business transactions. Are you buying or selling a car? Buying a car Selling a car Where are you buying it from? From another EU country From outside the EU If you are buying a car from another EU country, you don't need to pay customs duty when bringing your car to your country of residence. Who is the seller? A private person The seller is a VAT-registered business The car is new. For VAT purposes, a new car has done no more than 6 000 km OR has been supplied to the owner within 6 months of its first registration The car is used and registered in the EU. For VAT purposes, a used car has done more than 6 000 km AND has been supplied to the owner more than 6 months after its first registration If you buy a car from a private seller, you don't need to pay VAT in the country of the seller. You only have to pay VAT in the country where you register the car. VAT should be charged on the total price of the car - this includes any accessories or associated costs, such as delivery charges. The private seller will be able to get back a certain amount of VAT from the country where they initially bought the car. The amount of refundable VAT will normally be calculated by the tax authorities and will be proportional to the time that the seller used the car in the EU country.\u00a0For details on rules concerning the seller's obligations and how to get this VAT refunded,\u00a0the seller must contact the national tax authorities . You don't have to pay VAT on the car. The car is new. For VAT purposes, a new car has done no more than 6 000 km OR has been supplied to the owner within 6 months of its first registration The car is used and registered in the EU. For VAT purposes, a used car has done more than 6 000 km AND has been supplied to the owner more than 6 months after its first registration You have to pay VAT in the country where you register the car. VAT should be charged on the total price of the car - this includes any accessories or associated costs, such as delivery costs. If you are buying the car in one EU country and you intend to take and register it in another EU country, you need to inform the car dealer so you don't pay VAT there. If you have paid VAT twice, both in the country of purchase and in the country of registration, you are entitled to a refund. You must take this up first with the seller or, as a second step, with the tax authorities in the country where you have bought the car. Sample story Mario lives in Italy and decides to buy a new car in Germany. As the car is new, VAT should be paid in Italy, where Mario wants to register it. However, the seller is responsible for the VAT payment to the German financial authorities and must prove that the car is meant to be transported and registered in another EU country. Therefore, he requires Mario to pay German VAT as a guarantee. Once Mario registers his car in Italy and pays VAT there, he can send the proof to the German seller and ask for a refund of the VAT he paid in Germany. Warning The date taken into account for the supply of the car differs from country to country. It can be either the moment when you sign the purchase order or the moment when the invoice is issued. When you buy a used car from a car dealer, the VAT may or may not be charged and mentioned separately on the invoice. This depends on how the dealer opts to calculate VAT on this car. Find more on VAT applicable rules or consult the VAT authorities in the country where you are buying the car for further details. You don't have to pay VAT when you bring back a used car to another EU country. But you must register the car in the country where you permanently live and pay registration and road tax there. You have to pay customs duty and import VAT, as with any other imported goods. Consult the customs and VAT authorities in your country for details on the customs declaration, tax payments or tax relief. Is the car new or used? The car is new. For VAT purposes, a new car has done no more than 6 000 km OR has been supplied to the owner within 6 months of its first registration The car is used. For VAT purposes, a used car has done more than 6 000 km AND has been supplied to the owner more than 6 months after its first registration As a private seller, you don't have to charge VAT when you sell your car. If you sell a car classified as 'new' to a customer in another EU country, the buyer will have to pay VAT on the car in the EU country where they choose to register it. In this case, you will be able to get back a certain amount of VAT from the country where you initially bought the car. The amount of refundable VAT will be calculated by the tax authorities in the country where you first purchased the car and should be proportional to the length of time you used the car. Sample story Recover some of the VAT you paid if you sell your new car Sofie buys a new car in Denmark for EUR 30 000 plus EUR 7 500 VAT (25%). Over 4 months, she drives the car for 7 000 km. She then decides to sell it to Jonas for EUR 16 000. The car is still considered new for tax purposes. Jonas lives in Austria and brings the car there. He pays EUR 3 200 VAT to the Austrian tax authorities (20%, the VAT rate in Austria). As the seller, Sofie should be aware that she can recover some VAT. If VAT on the second sale had been charged in Denmark, the amount payable would have been EUR 4 000 (25% of EUR 16 000). As the car is still considered new, Sofie is therefore entitled to recover from the Danish authorities EUR 4 000 of the 7 500 in VAT she paid when she bought the car. Warning The date taken into account for the supply of the car differs from country to country. It can be either the moment when you sign the purchase order or the moment when the invoice is issued. As a private seller, you don't have to charge VAT on the sale.

If you move to another EU country, you don't usually have to exchange your driving licence for a local one. However, you can voluntarily exchange it for an equivalent one in your new country of residence if you wish. Voluntary exchange of your driving licence in another EU country If you want to voluntarily exchange your driving licence you must be a resident of that country and meet the conditions for having a driving licence (e.g. you have reached the minimum age, your state of health permits you to drive, etc.). Before the authorities exchange your driving licence, they will contact the authorities in your previous country of residence to check that your driving licence has not been restricted, suspended or withdrawn. If you exchange an old-style licence, you will be issued with the new standard format (plastic, credit card-sized photo card available since 2013). Obligatory exchange of your driving licence in another EU country You have to exchange your driving licence if: Your licence is lost, stolen or damaged After 2 years of usual residence, if you have a driving licence with an indefinite validity period (only if this is required by the national authorities in the country where you live) You commit a traffic offence in the country where you live Warning When you exchange your original driving licence for a local one, you will be subject to that country's rules on driving licences (for example on validity periods and medical checks). Sample story Monica lives in Cyprus and has an Italian driving licence which has been damaged. To get a new licence, she will have to exchange her Italian licence for a Cypriot one. She will receive a licence from Cyprus that is valid for 15 years, instead of 10 years as in Italy. Also, find out what you have to do if your driving licence is lost or stolen while you are travelling abroad. Driving licence recognition in the EU Is your driving licence recognised across the EU if you own: An old-style driving licence issued in the EU? If you have an old-style EU licence, you can still use it in all EU countries. If you renew it you will be issued with the EU standard model of licence. Otherwise you must exchange it by 2033 at the latest. A driving licence valid for life? EU Driving licences that are valid for life are recognised in all EU countries. However, you must check with the national authorities when you have to exchange it for the new standard model A provisional driving licence or temporary licence? Provisional or temporary licences and international driving permits (or any other certificates issued in your home country) are not regulated at EU level and may not be recognised in other EU countries. If you have a provisional driving licence and are moving to another EU country you should check the rules with the national driving licence authority in the country you're moving to. A driving licence issued in a non EU country? Some EU countries may recognise licences issued in a number of non-EU countries. If you have an EU driving licence that was issued in exchange for a non\u2011EU licence, and you wish to move to another EU country, you should be aware that your new licence may not be recognised there. Check the conditions for recognising non-EU licences with the local authorities in your new country. Sample story Angeles is a Chilean who moved to Spain a few years ago. As Spain recognises Chilean driving licences, Angeles was able to exchange hers for a Spanish one after fulfilling some administrative formalities. Angeles is free to drive in the EU with this new licence. However, if she moves from Spain to another EU country, she will have to check that the authorities there recognise her Spanish licence. If the new country recognises the original Chilean licence automatically, she will be able to continue driving with her converted Spanish licence. If not, she may have to have her Chilean licence formally recognised or exchanged in the new country.

If you have an accident while abroad, the law of the country where the accident took place is applied. This means that the process for claiming compensation might be different than in your home country. If you are involved in an accident abroad, don't leave the scene. Speak to the other driver, and call the police and/or emergency services, if necessary. Make sure that you write down the necessary details of the other person involved and the circumstances of the accident. Accident report You should complete an accident report at the scene of the accident. Your insurer will usually give you an accident statement form. Some insurers' associations have developed a common \"European Accident Statement\" form. It will help you quickly collect all the necessary information and will make it easier to settle any insurance claims. If you don't have an accident statement or an insurance form, make sure you write down the following information: date and place of the accident details of any injuries, material damage and witnesses (make sure you get their contact details) the other driver's contact details (name, address, phone number) the other driver's insurance company details (including policy number) information about the other driver's vehicle (registration number, country of registration, make and type \u2013 and the same information for any trailer) contact details of the police authorities to whom the accident was reported circumstances of the accident If you and the other driver agree on the circumstances of the accident, you should sign a statement. It will make it easier to settle the insurance claim. Remember \u2013 do not admit liability and only sign the accident report if you fully understand it. If you don't agree, your insurer will settle the dispute with the other driver's insurer. The insurer will base the settlement on the police report, assessment of the damage or other information. To support your claim you should collect: photos witness statements and/or a police report You must report the accident to your insurance company even if you don't want to make a claim. What's your situation? The accident was my fault Injuries to yourself and others Your insurance from your home country will cover you if you injure someone else (third party liability) in any EU country. However, cover for other types of damage such as any injuries you suffer (first party liability), fire damage, or theft abroad is not a standard part of most insurance policies. For these, you will have to check with your insurer before leaving the country. Your third party liability insurance policy covers all passengers travelling in your vehicle, except the driver. In most EU countries, you can also arrange additional first party cover for the driver. Damages \u2013 amounts You are covered up to the amounts set out in your insurance contract. EU law guarantees minimum liability coverage. If you are involved in an accident in another EU country, you will be covered for at least the following amounts: For personal injuries: \u20ac1\u00a0120\u00a0000 per victim or \u20ac5 600\u00a0000 per claim (no matter how many victims) For damage to property: \u20ac1 120\u00a0000 per claim (no matter how many of victims) If your insurance policy is from a country that applies higher liability coverage than the EU minimum, you will be covered up to that amount throughout the EU. If the actual damage exceeds the maximum amount in the country where the accident happened, and you don't have higher cover in your insurance policy, you will have to pay the difference.

Still have questions? Search terms The European Commission is not responsible for the content of external websites. You may want to check whether your insurer offers unlimited liability cover, especially for personal injuries. EU law guarantees that you receive the highest amount of liability cover available (see example below). Sample story EU law gives you maximum liability coverage Your home country applies the established EU minimum liability cover for material damages - \u20ac1 120\u00a0000. You cause an accident in another EU country, where the minimum liability cover is higher - \u20ac1 200\u00a0000. The material damages resulting from the accident have been estimated at \u20ac1 180\u00a0000, so \u20ac60\u00a0000 higher than the liability cover set in your home country. Although you have not agreed higher amounts with your insurer, you will be covered for \u20ac1 180\u00a0000 because EU law applies the most advantageous liability cover. In this case the cover applicable in the country where the accident took place. The accident was not my fault Accidents involving an uninsured driver Tell the police if you have an accident involving a driver who is not insured or who leaves the scene of the accident. Your insurance company will also be able to give you advice. You can also contact your national compensation body. It can intervene if the other person's vehicle is uninsured or the insurer cannot be identified. Compensation procedure If you suffered any loss, damage or injury resulting from the accident you can claim for compensation. You usually have to submit your claim within a certain time - check with your insurer. Claiming while abroad You should submit your claim for compensation to the insurance company of the person who caused the accident. Claiming when you get home You have 2 options: 1. Submit your claim to the national representative of the insurance company that covers the person who caused the accident. The claims representative in your country will check the information and take all the necessary steps to negotiate the settlement of your claim. To find out if that insurer has a national representative in your country, contact the national green card bureau/information centre. 2. Submit your claim to your country's national compensation body. If the insurer from the other EU country doesn't have a representative in your home country, you can send your claim to the national compensation body. This body will also help you if the other person's vehicle is uninsured or the insurer could not be identified. Sample story Submit your claim wherever is easiest for you Ignacio lives in Spain. During a holiday in Germany, he was the victim of a car accident caused by a German driver. As Ignacio doesn't speak German, he found it difficult to submit his claim for compensation in Germany. Ignacio instead decided to submit his claim to the Spanish national compensation body once he got back home. This meant he avoided the language problem and got his compensation. 3 months to receive an offer of compensation or reply If liability is not contested and the damage has been assessed, you should receive a reasoned offer of compensation within 3 months of submitting your compensation claim. If it's unclear whose fault the accident was, or how much compensation you are entitled to, you should receive a reasoned reply to the points made in the claim. If you don't receive a reply or an offer within 3 months, you are entitled to interest on the amount of compensation offered by the insurer or awarded by the court.

This compulsory insurance is valid in all other EU countries. It covers you if you have an accident causing damage to property or injury to anyone other than the driver. It doesn't cover other costs (e.g. the cost of repairs to your own vehicle). You can also take out additional, optional insurance, called first party liability, covering other risks. This insurance extends your cover (e.g. to injuries to the driver, damage to your vehicle, theft of your vehicle/its contents, vandalism, and legal assistance). There are no EU-wide rules on additional optional car insurance. Check the terms and conditions with your local insurer before you travel abroad. Insurers can apply different rules in each country. So your insurance could be limited by time (e.g. a month abroad) or by distance (e.g. 150km from the border of your home country) or might exclude some countries for some types of risk (such as theft). Car insurance in your host country You must register your car in the country where you normally live. You don't need to register your car in your host country if you can prove that you are staying there only temporarily e.g. as a student. When you register, you will have to present proof that you have insurance coverage. The car registration authorities should accept insurance cover from any insurance company: based in that country or with an office there without an office in that country but authorised to provide services there. Warning If you are moving to another EU country and need to re-register your car, you will have to check with your insurer whether your current contract will be valid in the country you are moving to. In principle, you can also insure your car in an EU country different from your country of residence. But remember to check if the insurance company offers international services. Sample story Is insurance from my home country valid abroad? Lazlo, who is from Slovenia, moved to Ireland, taking his car, for which he has a standard Slovenian insurance policy. Once in Ireland, he'll need to register his car with the Irish authorities and find out if he can drive on his Slovenian insurance. If not, he'll have to take out new insurance in Ireland.

Still have questions? Search terms The European Commission is not responsible for the content of external websites. Buying new insurance abroad If your current contract is not valid in the country you are moving to, or expires if you re-register your car there, you can contact the national green card bureau/information centre to ask which insurers offer car insurance in that country. Insurance premiums and claims history Motor insurance premiums differ from one EU country to another, mainly due to differences in national contract laws, risk assessments and compensation schemes or complex and expensive international claims management. In some EU countries, your claims history can affect your insurance premiums. You may have heard this called a no-claims discount, no-claims bonus or bonus-malus system. If you make no claims during the year, your insurer may give you a discount when you renew your contract. But if you made a claim, you may be asked to pay more. You can ask your insurer at any time for a record of any claims you have made over the last 5 years. They must provide this within 15 days. But if you have to take out new car insurance in another EU country, the new insurer is not obliged to take account of your previous claims record (or any reductions you might have been eligible for) when calculating your premium. Warning Some insurers will consider your claims record, though, so always shop around. Sample story I have a good driving record at home, so why is insurer abroad charging me a higher premium? Rosa is from Italy and recently moved to France. She had been driving for 10 years in Italy with no claims and so the premiums for her Italian insurance were relatively cheap. Several French insurers refused to consider Rosa's driving record in Italy, so she shopped around until she found one who would \u2013 enabling her to obtain cheaper insurance.

Still have questions? Search terms To register your car, you will have to submit a number of documents. Roadworthiness certificate and proof of roadworthiness Registration certificate Proof of ownership Proof of value-added tax (VAT) payment Proof of insurance cover Certificate of conformity for new cars Roadworthiness certificate and proof of roadworthiness As a car owner, you are responsible for keeping your car in roadworthy condition as well as presenting it for roadworthiness testing 4 years after the first time it has been registered and every 2 years thereafter. If you move to another EU country and want to re-register your car there, you will have to provide proof to the authorities that your car has passed a roadworthiness test in your former country of residence. Warning The testing frequency may differ significantly from one EU country to another. The proof of roadworthiness should be displayed visibly in your car and include the test results, the identity of the vehicle and the date of the next test. The validity of the roadworthiness certificate should be recognised even if the ownership of the car changes. Registration certificate When you register your car in the EU, the authorities will issue you with a registration certificate. The registration certificate will have one or two parts, this varies according to national rules in your country. Your car registration certificate has to be recognised by other EU countries when you travel or move to another EU country. If you need to re-register your car in another EU country, you will have to submit the original car registration certificate to the registration authorities in your new country. If your certificate consists of two parts, you have to submit both parts. Some EU countries may require additional documents before re-registering your car, so you should check the exact requirements in your new country. You should have your car registration certificate with you when travelling by car or when moving abroad. Part I is sufficient if the document has two parts. Proof of ownership You may be asked to prove that you are the legal owner of the vehicle. Invoices used as proof of purchase should clearly state the VAT number of the car dealer. Proof of value-added tax (VAT) payment When you register your vehicle, national authorities are entitled to check whether VAT has been correctly paid. VAT rules vary depending on whether your car is new or used and whether you buy it from a professional dealer or from a private individual. For VAT purposes, a new car has done no more than 6 000 km OR has been in use for no more than 6 months. Check where you have to pay VAT for a car bought in another EU country. Proof of insurance cover When you register your car, you will have to present proof that you have insurance cover. The authorities should accept insurance cover from any insurance company: based in the country you live or which has a branch office there without an office in your country but authorised to provide services there Certificate of conformity for new cars The certificate of conformity is issued by the manufacturer and shows that the technical characteristics of the vehicle meet safety and environmental standards. It can be either a European (EC) or a national certificate. EC certificate of conformity The EC certificate of conformity is valid in all EU countries. If your car has a valid EC certificate, national authorities cannot request any additional technical documentation - unless your car has been modified since leaving the factory, they can then require it to undergo a new approval. National certificate of conformity The national certificate of conformity is valid only in the country of issue. It is usually issued for buses, trucks, vans, trailers and custom-built vehicles produced before May 2009 or vintage cars. If your car is already registered and you move it to another EU country, the authorities in your new country will often require additional technical checks or certificates before re-registering your vehicle.

Warning Most of the rules that apply to cars, apply also to trailers. Moving on a permanent basis If you move permanently to another EU country and take your car with you, you should register your car and pay car-related taxes in your new country. There are no common EU rules on vehicle registration and related taxes. Some countries have tax-exemption rules for vehicle registration when moving with the car from one country to another permanently. To benefit from a tax exemption, you must check the applicable deadlines and conditions in the country you wish to move to. Check the exact rules and deadlines with the national authorities: Choose country: Austriaaten Belgium*be Belgium - Flandersbe-vlgen Belgium - Wallonia*be-wal Bulgaria*bg Croatiacren Cyprus*cy Czechia*cz Denmarkdken Estoniaeeen Finlandfien France*fr Germany*de Greecegren Hungary*hu Irelandieen Italy*it Latvia*lv Lithuanialten Luxembourgluen Maltamten Netherlands*nl Norwaynoen Polandplen Portugal*pt Romania*ro Slovakia*sk Sloveniasien Spaineses Swedenseen * Information not yet available. Still have questions? Search terms Sample story Know the rules to avoid fines Cristina from Spain found a job in Bordeaux and moved there permanently. She registered herself in the municipal register as living in Bordeaux. After a couple of months, she decided to bring her Spanish registered car to France but kept driving with her Spanish registered car. 8 months after her move she was stopped by the traffic police during a routine check. As she was driving with a Spanish registration plate, she was given a large fine because she needed to re-register her car within 1 month after establishing her main residence to France. Given that she had registered as having her main residence in Bordeaux, she is presumed to have her normal residence in France and, according to national rules she must register her car in France and pay vehicle registration taxes there. Moving on a temporary basis (not changing normal residence) If you move temporarily to another EU country without changing your normal residence you do not have to register your car or pay any registration taxes there. You can keep your car registered in your country of normal residence. Your normal residence is the place where you usually live, work or have family (for more than 185 days in a calendar year). If you do not work, the normal residence is considered the place where you have personal ties which show close links between you and the place where you are living. If you work in a place but your personal ties are in another EU country, you are usually considered having your normal residence in the EU country of your personal ties, provided that you return there regularly. If you are stopped by the police in the country where you're temporary staying, you will need to demonstrate that you are not living there permanently. This can sometimes be difficult. When driving, it is a good habit to have with you your car registration certificate, the certificate of ownership and a proof of your normal residence (generally an ID card or document showing that you are registered as a resident in another EU country). Sample story Know the rules to avoid fines Massimo, an Italian national, found a job in Romania and decided to move permanently there. In accordance with Italian and Romanian rules, he de-registered his residence from Italy, registered his residence in Romania and was listed in the Italian registry of Italians living abroad. He also registered his car in Romania. After several months of living in Romania, Massimo drove back to Italy with his Romanian registered car. As he jumped a red light, the police stopped him and asked him all the papers. Massimo gave his Italian ID card \u2013which still hadn't been updated with the new address. As he could not demonstrate to the police that he was now a permanent resident in Romania, the police imposed a heavy fine. If you are temporarily driving around in your new EU country, you should not lend or rent your car (still registered in another EU country) to a resident of that EU country. This is because the person could become subject to a fine. You may, however, lend your car to visiting friends or family members as long as they do not have their residence in that EU country. Penalty points and fines You may be fined: if you have to register your car but you fail to do so on time if you don't pay the relevant taxes if you drive with a number plate from another EU country without a proof of normal residence in another EU country and a valid roadworthiness test. You can check the exact rules that apply to car registration in the country you are moving to on the websites of the national authorities: Choose country: Austriaaten Belgiumbeen Bulgaria*bg Croatiacren Cyprus*cy Czechia*cz Denmarkdken Estoniaeeen Finlandfien France*fr Germany*de Greece*gr Hungary*hu Irelandieen Italy*it Latvia*lv Lithuanialten Luxembourg*lu Maltamten Netherlands*nl Norwaynoen Polandplen Portugal*pt Romania*ro Slovakia*sk Sloveniasien Spaineses Swedenseen * Information not yet available. Still have questions? Search terms Specific rules for students and cross-border workers Students that reside in another Member State for the sole purpose of pursuing their studies and cross-border workers don't usually have to pay car registration and circulation taxes. Check the exact rules on\u00a0car taxes in another EU country\u00a0that apply to\u00a0students and cross-border workers. Students If you are a student and you move to another EU country with the sole of pursuing your studies, you can drive your car registered in your home country without having to register it or pay taxes in your new country. As a student, you must be enrolled in an educational establishment in that country and be able to provide a valid enrolment certificate. If you start working during your studies, however, you will have to register your car in that country. Before leaving your home country, you should check the applicable rules in the country where you are going to study. You may need to fulfil some administrative formalities or meet certain conditions in order to avoid problems during police checks. Warning Denmark, Estonia, Germany,\u00a0and Sweden do not exempt students from registering their cars and from paying the corresponding taxes. Sample story Mathieu from France moved to Belgium where he is doing a 2-year post-graduate course. Mathieu's car was damaged, so he went to the police to get a report for his insurer. When the police discovered that Mathieu had been living in Belgium for over a year without registering his car there, they told him that his situation was irregular and would be fined. Mathieu could prove, however, that he was registered at Antwerp University and that as a student from another EU country, he didn't have to pay car or road taxes in Belgium. Cross-border workers As a cross-border worker (work in one country and live in another one), you may need to drive a car that is registered in only one of the two countries. If you drive a company car registered in the country where you work, you may also use it in the country where you live without having to register it there. Check the different conditions that apply to the use of company cars\u00a0in the EU as the rules may vary considerably. If you use your own car to commute regularly from the country where you live to the country where you work, you have to register it and pay the relevant taxes in the country where you live - but not in the country where you work.

Each EU country determines what taxes you should pay if you regularly use your car on its territory. In some cases, the amount of car registration tax may correspond to the period you use your car in your new country. But you may not be taxed higher than a resident of your new country. In some cases, when you change countries, you may be entitled to a car registration tax exemption or a car registration tax refund. You should contact the national authorities before moving to your new country in order to avoid double taxation. Exemptions from car registration taxes In most EU countries, students, cross-border workers and secondary residents don't have to pay car registration taxes. They may need, however, to pay road taxes. Students If you move to another EU country to study or to carry out a job with a limited and defined duration, for example as a volunteer, you can drive your car registered in your home country without having to register it or pay taxes in your new country. As a student, you must be enrolled in an educational establishment in that country and be able to provide a valid enrolment certificate. If you start working during your studies, however, you will have to register your car in that country. Before leaving your home country, you should check the applicable rules in the country where you are going to study. You may need to fulfil some administrative formalities or meet certain conditions in order to avoid problems during police checks.

The declaration should be submitted in writing and at any time before providing your services for the first time. Once submitted, the declaration is valid for one year. What you need to submit If a declaration is required, you can submit it directly to the host country authority responsible for your profession (to find out which authority it is, ask the national contact point there). Your declaration should contain the following: your name, surname and contact details your nationality the name of profession in the country where you usually work the name of profession you wish to practise in the host country information on your professional liability insurance: insurer, contract number (ask your employer) reference to any declarations submitted previously in the same country If you submit a declaration for the first time or if there is any change in your situation, you should include the following supporting documents: proof of your nationality proof that you are legally established in an EU country and not prohibited from practising your regulated profession, even temporarily evidence of professional qualifications (you may need to submit a certified translation) proof that you have never been convicted of a criminal offence if you work in the field of security The documents you need to submit may vary depending on your profession and on the EU country where you want to practise it. Contact the host country authority responsible for your profession to check which type of documents you will need to submit. What happens with your declaration In most cases, you can submit your declaration any time before you start working in the host country (even if you aren't sure you'll actually be working). Once, you have submitted your declaration, you can immediately start practising your profession. Warning If your regulated profession is related to health and safety and you don't benefit from automatic recognition, you may need to wait for your host country to check your qualifications before you can start working for the first time. In this case, you will need to wait for formal authorisation before you can start working. You may need to renew your declaration once a year if you intend to continue providing temporary services in your host country.

EPC If your profession is regulated and you need to apply for the recognition of your professional qualifications, you may apply for recognition using the European Professional Card (EPC). The EPC is an electronic procedure you can use to have your regulated profession recognised in another EU country. For the moment, you can use the EPC procedure only if you are: a nurse responsible for general care a pharmacist a physiotherapist a mountain guide a real estate agent Advantages of the European Professional Card Your home country authorities will assist you with your application and check that it is correct and complete. They will also certify the authenticity and validity of your documents. For any future applications, you won't have to upload your documents again. If the host country authorities in charge of your application do not take a final decision within the set deadline, recognition will be granted automatically and you will be able to generate an EPC certificate from your online account. Warning If the authorities refuse to issue an EPC based on your application, they have to give you reasons and information on how to appeal this decision. The EPC procedure is currently available only for a limited number of professions. Check if you can apply with the EPC Choose a situation I am a nurse responsible for general care, a pharmacist, a physiotherapist, a mountain guide or a real estate agent. I work in another sector. Did you obtain your professional qualification from an EU country? Yes No Choose a situation: My qualification has already been recognised in the EU and I have exercised my profession for at least 3 years in the EU country that recognised my qualification. My qualification hasn't been recognised in the EU yet. You can't apply for an EPC. You need to use the standard application procedure. You can apply for an EPC regardless of whether you want to provide your services permanently or temporarily in your host country. The EPC procedure is easier and quicker to manage than the standard recognition procedure, and more transparent: you can keep track of your application online and re-use documents previously uploaded to start new applications for different countries. Warning The EPC is an electronically generated certificate, not a physical card. It is electronic proof that you have passed the professional qualifications administrative checking procedure and that you have met the conditions required to provide services temporarily or permanently in that country. When an application is approved, you will be able to generate an EPC certificate in pdf format. It will include a reference number any prospective employer can use to check your EPC validity online. If you are not sure whether you need to apply for an EPC for temporary mobility or establishment purpose, you can ask the national authorities. If you plan to settle in the country long-term (establishment) you may also need to register with a professional body or undergo additional checks before starting to practise your profession. You can also check with the national authorities whether this is required in your case. The EPC is optional so you can decide whether to use this procedure or use the standard (paper-based) procedure for professional recognition. You can't apply for an EPC. You first need to have your qualifications recognised in one EU country and work there for at least 3 years before you can apply for an EPC. You can apply for an EPC only if you are a nurse, a pharmacist, a physiotherapist, a mountain guide or a real estate agent. If you have a different profession, you must use the standard application procedure. Applying for an EPC To apply for an EPC, you need to: create an EU Login account, if you don't have one already sign in with an EU Login, the European Commission's authentication service (once you have signed in, you will be redirected to the EPC interface) complete your EPC profile with your personal information and contact details create an application upload electronically scanned copies of the relevant documents (each supporting document should be scanned and then uploaded as a separate file.) submit all relevant documents to your home country authority. Check the EPC User guide for more detailed information. Warning Once the first application is submitted, you can no longer update your personal data (ID or passport number, your last name or nationality - which will appear on the certificate) yourself, but you will need to ask the authority handling your file to update these data. For each application, both home country and host country authorities may charge fees to examine your file. If they do, you will receive a separate invoice from each authority. Authorities may also ask you to provide certified copies of your documents if they can't verify their validity. The EPC is valid: indefinitely if you are settling long-term 18 months if you are providing services temporarily 12 months if you are providing services temporarily and your profession is related to public health or safety (for example, you are a physiotherapist or a mountain guide). If the host country authorities don't make a decision within the legal deadlines, your qualifications are tacitly recognised and you can generate an EPC certificate from your online account. If the authorities reject your application, they have to explain why and how you can appeal. Procedure and deadlines What's your situation? I am moving permanently and want to practice my profession in my host country This is what happens once you have submitted your application: within 1 week: your home country authority acknowledges receipt of your application, informs you if any documents are missing and any about fees they apply your home country authority has up to 1 month to check your application and forward it to the host country if you are a pharmacist or nurse and benefit from automatic recognition, the host country takes a final decision within maximum 2 months (1 month +two 2-week extensions) if you don't benefit from automatic recognition, the host country takes a final decision within maximum 3 months (2 months + two 2-week extensions) if the host country authorities find that your education, training and professional experience don't meet the standards required in that country, they could ask you to undergo an aptitude test or an adaptation traineeship. I want to provide my services temporarily in my host country This is what happens once you have submitted your application: within 1 week: your home country authority acknowledges receipt of your application, informs you if any documents are missing, and about any fees they apply authorities in the host country will also check your file if your profession could have an impact on public health and safety and you can't benefit from automatic recognition if host country checks are not needed, your home country authority reviews your application and takes a final decision within maximum 3 weeks if host country checks are needed, your home country authority has up to 1 month to review your application and forward it to the host country the host country takes a final decision within maximum 3 months (2 months + two 2-week extensions).

Warning The authorities are obliged to accept sworn translations from any EU country. The authorities cannot ask you for sworn translations of your identity card, passport or other documents not related to your qualifications. Language tests Your new country might require you to have some knowledge of the national language(s) especially if this knowledge is important for practising your profession. However, language requirements may not exceed what is objectively necessary for practising your profession. Warning As long as language skills are not part of your qualification, the application for the recognition of your professional qualification and the requirement to prove language skills are not related. Therefore, the recognition of your professional qualification cannot be refused or postponed because of a lack of language skills. What is a sufficient proof of language skills One of the following documents is enough to prove your language skills: a copy of a qualification received in the language(s) of your host country a university degree taught in the language(s) of your host country a language certificate awarded by a recognised language institution such as the Goethe Institute, etc. proof of previous professional experience in your host country. If you cannot provide any of these documents, you may be required to do an interview or a test (oral and/or written). Before you start working Once your qualifications have been recognised, the authorities must allow you to use the academic title you had in your home country, and possibly an abbreviated form in the language of your home country, as well as the professional title used in your new country. If your profession is regulated by an association or organisation (as it is often the case for lawyers or doctors) in the country where you want to work, you will have to become a member before you can use your professional title.

If your profession is regulated in the EU country where you want to practise, you may need to apply to get your professional qualification recognised there. Warning Regulated professions differ across the EU. Check the regulated professions database to find out if your profession is regulated in the EU country you are moving to. How to use the regulated professions database select the EU country where your qualification was awarded and the country you want to work in search for your profession in your native language If the profession you want to exercise does not appear, it may mean that it's not regulated in the country you are moving to. If you don't find any information about your profession in the database, you can ask the national contact points for professional qualifications in the country where you want to work. They can help you understand the rules which apply in your case. Specific EU rules apply to the recognition of professional qualifications of certain sectors such as lawyers, air traffic controllers, pilots, etc.. Check if you need to apply for recognition of professional qualifications and what type of application you need to submit. Did you obtain your professional qualification from an EU country? Yes No What is your situation? I am a doctor, a nurse for general care, a midwife, a dental practitioner, a pharmacist, an architect or a veterinary surgeon. I work in a different sector. If you have obtained your qualification from a non-EU country and you want to work in an EU country, you need to get it recognised in the EU country where you want to work. In this case, your application for professional recognition is subject to national rules. If you want to move to another EU country and you have already worked for at least 3 years in the EU country that has first recognised your qualifications, you can apply for professional recognition in another EU country under the rules that apply to professionals that have received their qualification from an EU country. To prove that you have the necessary experience to exercise your profession, you may need a certificate issued by the EU country that first recognised your qualifications. This applies to both EU citizens and non-EU citizens. As a doctor, nurse for general care, midwife, dental practitioner, pharmacist, architect and veterinary surgeon, you enjoy automatic recognition of your professional qualification. You will need to submit proof of your qualification and wait for permission from the authorities before you can start working. Warning If your training doesn't meet the minimum requirements for your degree in the host country, you may not benefit from automatic recognition and you will need to apply for professional recognition following the procedure for other regulated professions. In addition to your professional certificates, you may need to submit other supporting documents to the competent authorities depending on your profession and the country you are moving to. Once the relevant national authorities receive your documents, they: have to acknowledge receipt within 1 month may ask you for additional documents have to take a decision within 3 months of receiving your certification papers. If you are a nurse responsible for general care or a pharmacist, you can use the European Professional Card (EPC) \u2013 a quicker and easier electronic procedure - to submit your documents, keep track of your online applications and re-use documents previously uploaded. Warning The authorities in your new country can't require sworn translations of your qualifications. Sample story Knowing your rights can help you avoid red tape Katarina is a pharmacist from Slovakia and would like to work in Austria. The Austrian authorities ask her to provide sworn translations (provided by an Austrian translator) of all her supporting documents. But Katarina cannot be required to provide sworn translations of her diplomas. For several categories of diploma - doctor, nurse for general care, midwife, veterinary surgeon, dental practitioner, pharmacist, and architect - sworn translations are not required. You may be required to sit a language test or become a member of the professional association in your host country before you can start practising your profession there. My profession is regulated in the EU country I am moving to. My profession isn't regulated in the EU country I am moving to. You don't need to request permission or start any administrative procedure. You can practise your profession in your new EU country under the same conditions as the nationals of that country. Warning Your profession may not be regulated as such but be considered part of another regulated profession. Always check with the national authorities of your new country if your profession is regulated there or not. The national contact point for professional qualifications will help you identify the authority that can give you this information. Sample story Piotr, an ambulance nurse from the Czech Republic is moving to Germany and wants to continue practicing his profession there. When he checked the professional database, Piotr didn't find his profession listed and thought that it may not be regulated in Germany. However, when he contacted the German authorities responsible for the recognition of professional qualifications, he was told that the qualifications required for an ambulance nurse in Germany form part of the paramedic profession. As Piotr doesn't have the necessary qualification in this area, he needs to undertake a traineeship before he can start working. I am moving permanently and want to practice my profession in my host country. I want to provide my services temporarily in my host country. You need to apply for recognition of professional qualifications in your new country before you can practise. Check what documents you need to submit when applying for the recognition of your professional qualification. If you are a physiotherapist, a mountain guide, or a real estate agent, you can use the European Professional Card \u2013 a quicker and easier electronic procedure - to submit your documents, keep track of your online applications and re-use already documents previously uploaded.

Always check with the national authorities of your new country if your profession is regulated there or not. The national contact point for professional qualifications will help you identify the authority that can give you this information. Sample story Dirk is a young Dutch real estate agent who recently moved to Austria. As his profession is not regulated in the Netherlands, he expected to set up his business as an independent real estate agent in Austria without having to complete any administrative procedures. When registering as a self-employed person, however, he was told that he would need to have his qualifications recognised in order to be allowed to practise as a real estate agent in Austria. This slowed down his plans considerably. You don't need to apply for recognition of professional qualifications except for professions having health and safety implications. However, your may need to submit a prior written declaration (paper or electronic) in the country you're going to before you can practise your profession. To get your qualifications recognised in your new country, you will need to prove that you have exercised your profession in your home country for at least 1 year during the last 10 years. Warning If your regulated profession is related to health and safety and you don't benefit from automatic recognition, the competent authorities in your host country may check your professional qualifications before you start working. In this case, you will have to wait for formal authorisation before you can practise your profession. You may need to renew your declaration once a year if you intend to continue providing temporary services in the same host country. To find out if this is required check with the contact point for professional qualifications in the host country. Check what else you may need before you submit your written declaration. You may be asked to sit a language test or become a member of a professional association in your host country before you can start practising. Sample story Risto is a Finnish architect who is planning to move to Italy. Before leaving, he checks in the regulated professions database what formalities are required to start working there and the Italian contact point for his profession.

You'll have to apply to the pension authority in the country where you're living or you last worked. If you've never worked in the country where you're living, your host country will forward your claim to the one you last worked in. That country is then responsible for processing your claim and bringing together records of your contributions from all the countries you worked in. In some countries, the pension authority should send you your pension application form before you reach that country's retirement age. If you don't receive it, check with your pension authority to see whether they will automatically send it to you. Warning You should ask for information on obtaining your pension at least 6 months before you retire because drawing a pension from several countries can be a long procedure. Documents you'll need These vary from one country to another, but you usually have to supply your bank details and some form of identification. For more exact details, contact the pension authority handling your claim. Differences in retirement ages In some EU countries, you will have to wait longer to start drawing your pension than in others. You can only receive your pension from the country where you now live (or last worked) once you have reached the legal retirement age in that country. If you have accumulated pension rights in other countries, you will only receive those parts of your pension once you have reached the legal retirement age in those countries. So it's important to find out in advance, from all the countries where you have worked, what your situation will be if you change the date on which you start receiving your pension. If you take one pension earlier than the other, it might affect the amounts you receive. You can get more advice from the relevant authority in the country where you live and/or in the countries where you worked.

Search terms Sample story Be aware of different (later!) retirement ages in other countries Caroline from France worked in Denmark for 15 years, then went back to France towards the end of her career. When she turned 60, she applied for her pension, as is usual in France, but only got a very low one. At 60, Caroline is only entitled to the French part of her pension. She will receive the Danish part when she turns 67 \u2014 the legal retirement age in Denmark for Caroline's age group. Eligibility periods In some EU countries, you must have worked for a minimum period of time to be entitled to a pension. In such cases, the pension authority has to take into account all the periods you've worked in other EU countries, as if you'd been working in that country all along, to assess whether you're entitled to a pension (principle of aggregation of periods). If it fails to do so, contact our assistance services for help. Sample story Tom worked for 4 years in Germany and 32 years in Portugal. In Germany, you must have worked for at least 5 years to be entitled to a pension. Tom would not normally qualify for the national pension scheme in Germany as he had worked there for only 4 years. However, the German pension authority had to take into account the years Tom worked in Portugal. It recognised his entitlement and is paying him a pension for the 4 years worked in Germany. Periods of insurance of less than one year If you have been covered for less than a year in one country, a special rule may apply, as some EU countries do not provide a pension for short periods: your months of insurance or residence in the country where you worked for a short time will not be lost but taken into account in the calculation of your pension by the countries where you worked longer. If you have a problem obtaining the payment of a pension for working periods of less than a year, contact our assistance services for help. How your pension is calculated Pension authorities in each EU country you've worked in will look at the contributions you've paid into their system, how much you've paid in other countries, and for how long you've worked in different countries. The EU-equivalent rate Each pension authority will calculate the part of the pension it should pay taking into account periods completed in all EU countries. To do so, it will add together the periods you completed in all EU countries and work out how much pension you would get had you contributed into its own scheme over the entire time (called the theoretical amount). This amount will then be adjusted to reflect the actual time you were covered in that country (called the pro-rata benefit). The national rate If you meet the conditions for entitlement to a national pension irrespective of any periods completed in other countries, the pension authority will also calculate the national pension (known as an independent benefit). Result The national authority will then compare the pro-rata benefit and the independent benefit; you will receive whichever is higher from that EU country. Each country's decision on your claim will be explained in a special note, the P1 form, you will receive. Sample story Rosa worked for 20 years in France and 10 years in Spain. Both countries apply a minimum period of 15 years of work in order to have the right to a pension. Each country will calculate Rosa's pension: The French authority will make a double calculation: It will calculate Rosa's national pension for the 20 years worked in France - let's say EUR 800. It will also calculate a theoretical amount, the pension Rosa would have had if she had worked the full 30 years in France - let's say EUR 1 500. Then, it will determine the pro-rata pension, that is the part of this amount which should be paid for the years worked in France: 1 500x20 years in France/30 years in total= EUR 1 000. Rosa is entitled to the higher amount \u2014 EUR 1 000 a month. The Spanish authority will not calculate the national pension because Rosa has worked in Spain less than the minimum period required. It will only calculate the EU-equivalent rate - starting with the theoretical amount, the pension Rosa would have had if she had worked all the 30 years in Spain - let's say EUR 1 200. Then, it will determine the pro-rata pension - the part of this amount which should be paid for the years worked in Spain: 1200x10 years in Spain/30 years in total= EUR 400. In the end, Rosa will receive a pension of EUR 1 400. Payment of your pension Each country that grants you a pension generally pays the corresponding amount into a bank account in your country of residence - if you live within the EU. If you do not live in the EU, you might need to open a bank account in each EU country which pays you a pension. Invalidity / survivors' pensions The rules mentioned above also apply to the calculation of invalidity pensions and survivors' pensions. It is important to know that: If you claim an invalidity pension or incapacity benefit, each country you have worked in could insist on examining you separately \u2014 and may well reach different verdicts. One might assess you as seriously incapacitated while another may not consider you incapacitated at all. Some EU countries do not pay survivor's pensions. If your husband or wife works abroad and you are counting on the possibility of a survivor's pension, check whether they exist in that country.

Warning Before you sign a contract for a supplementary pension scheme, check how moving/living abroad will affect your pension rights. If there are any adverse effects, these are illegal. If you leave a supplementary pension scheme because you move to another EU country to work, you have the same rights as people who stay in the same country but stop paying contributions \u2014 for example, because they change jobs. Sample story Fred worked for 8 years in country A for a company which had a generous supplementary pension package. He found a job in another country and started working for an employer who also offered a supplementary pension package. Fred left the supplementary scheme in country A but the insurer told him that his acquired rights would not be preserved if he moved to another country. Fred contacted a European consumer centre and obtained legal support. In the end, his previous insurer agreed to preserve his contributions in country A. Warning Pension companies sometimes penalise people who move abroad, by refusing to pay pensions, charging additional costs or requiring them to refund interest earned during the saving period. This is illegal \u2014 if it happens to you, you can call on the European Consumer Centres Sample story Anna worked 4 years for the same employer in country A before moving to country B where she remained definitively. When she retired, she applied for her supplementary pension from country A, but the insurer refused, arguing that payment was only due to people who stayed in the scheme for over 5 years. Anna felt discriminated against for having moved abroad to work and sued her insurer. But she lost the case because the 5-year requirement applied to all members of this scheme, whether they changed their country of employment or not. Warning If you move abroad, your previous country of residence may require you to pay back any tax rebates you obtained while saving for a supplementary pension there. This is illegal \u2014 your supplementary pension must benefit from the same tax treatment as supplementary pensions paid to residents of that country. If you feel discriminated against, you can get help here.

Fortunately, however, most countries have double tax agreements. These agreements usually spare you from double taxation: under many bilateral tax agreements, the amount of tax you paid in the country where you work will be offset against the tax you owe in your country of residence in other cases, the income earned in the country where you work might be taxable only in that country and exempt from tax in your country of residence You should note that the tax rates in the two countries involved will most likely be different. If the tax rate in the country where you work is higher, that is the final rate you will pay - even if the tax paid in that country is offset against the tax due in your country of residence, or if your country of residence exempts you from any further tax. In order to claim relief from double taxation, you may need to prove where you are resident and that you have already paid taxes on your income. Check with the tax authorities what proof and which documents you need to submit. Warning All EU countries regularly exchange tax information to ensure taxpayers meet their obligations and to combat tax fraud and tax evasion. The information below describes the most common double taxation treaty rules, in line with the OECD model tax convention; please check the details of the tax treaty relevant to your situation. What rules apply if you are: A cross-border commuter If you live in one EU country and work in another, the taxation rules applicable to your income will depend on national laws and double tax agreements between these two countries - and rules can differ considerably from those that determine which country is in charge of social security issues. Depending on the double tax agreement, you may have to pay taxes in your country of work as well as in your country of residence: If you are an employee, the country where you work will, in most cases, tax the income you earn on its territory. If you are self-employed and registered as such in the country where you live but provide services across the border, you will generally have to pay income tax in the country where you provide services if you set up a 'fixed base' or 'permanent establishment' (such as an office or a shop) there. Check with the tax authorities which rules apply to your case. If you live in one EU country but earn all or almost all of your income in another and pay tax there, the country where you earn your income should treat you as it would treat a resident - that is, it should give you the same tax reliefs and tax exemptions and any other tax benefits available to residents, such as personal allowances, or the possibility to complete a joint tax return with your spouse. The European employment services' cross-border partnerships in your region will be able to help you find out if there are any special tax arrangements in place for cross-border commuters that would apply to you. A worker posted abroad If you are posted abroad for a short assignment (up to 2 years), you will remain under your home country's social security system. However, the income earned during a posting abroad may be taxed in the host country. When posted abroad by your company, you may not have to pay tax in the country where you work on the income you earn during your posting if: You stay abroad for less than 6 months in a year and Your salary is paid directly by your employer (at home), rather than by a branch or other company your employer has in the country where you work A company director or board member If you live in one country and are a member of the management board of a company in another, the country where the company is located may tax fees and income related to this role. EU countries may treat as part of your fees any benefits in kind (for instance stock options or company car) that you receive as a board member. If, alongside your role as a board member, you work for the same company as an adviser, a consultant or an ordinary employee, your income from these functions will most likely be subject to the same tax treatment as that applied to other cross-border commuters (see above). An employee working in one EU country for a company based in another If you live in one EU country and work there for a company based in another EU country you will normally, under most tax treaties, be subject to tax only in your country of residence. A mobile artist or sports professional When you work in another EU country - outside the EU country where you're tax resident - as an entertainer (such as a musician, theatre, film, radio or television artist) or as a sports professional, income you receive can be taxed in the country where the money was earned. This may be the case even if you're paid indirectly via another person or a company (such as a management company, team, troupe or orchestra). The length of your stay abroad, and whether or not you have a fixed base there are often not taken into account: the decisive element is the performance in the country. However, if the performance or event is exclusively or mainly supported by public funds or if the money you earned is insignificant, some countries will not tax your income. Your income will, however, will still be subject to the tax rules of your home country (the country where you are tax resident). Your home country will often either: exempt from tax the money you earned from performances or events in another EU country, or grant you tax relief for any income tax paid at source in the country where you earned the money To claim a tax refund or tax relief in the country where you live, you will probably have to show some documents proving that you paid tax on the income you earned abroad. You may need to provide sworn translations of any official documents used to support your claim. A civil servant abroad If you are seconded to work abroad as a civil servant, or if you live in one EU country but work as a civil servant in another, the following conditions usually apply: you will continue to pay tax on the income from your civil servant job only in the country of the administration that employs you you will pay income tax only in the country where you work if you are resident there and you are a national of that country or you did not move there just for the purpose of working as a civil servant (for example you were already living there before being recruited as a civil servant). An unemployed person looking for work abroad If you spend a short period (less than 6 months a year) in another EU country without working there, you probably won't be considered a resident for tax purposes in that country. In that case, any transferred unemployment benefits should be taxed only in the country that pays them. If you spend more than 6 months in a year in another EU country, you could be considered tax-resident of that country and unemployment benefits transferred from another country may be taxed there. Indeed, under many bilateral tax agreements, unemployment benefits are subject to tax only in the country of tax residence. Warning However, if you keep a permanent home and strong personal and economic ties with your home country, you could still be considered a tax-resident of your home country, even if you stay abroad for more than 6 months. In this case, the other EU country may not be entitled to tax your unemployment benefits A retired person abroad If you have retired to another EU country and spend more than 6 months a year there, that country may consider you a tax-resident. If so, you may have to pay tax to that country on your total worldwide income - including pensions you receive from other EU countries. Exception: public sector pensions are usually taxed only in the country of the administration that employed you. Sources you should check This is only a summary of what usually happens. To find out what the rules are in your case: ask a local tax office check the double tax agreement between your host country and the country where you are tax-resident if you are a civil servant working abroad, check the applicable international law and any special international diplomatic/consular agreement - to find out if, as a civil servant, you are entitled to any tax privileges in the country where you work FAQs FAQs - Double taxation EU legislation Council Directive on the mandatory exchange of tax-related information Affected by Brexit?

There are no EU-wide rules that say how EU nationals who live, work or spend time outside their home countries are to be taxed on their income. However, the country where you are resident for tax purposes can usually tax your total worldwide income, earned or unearned. This includes wages, pensions, benefits, income from property or from any other sources, or capital gains from sales of property, from all countries worldwide. Warning EU countries regularly exchange income tax information to ensure taxpayers meet their obligations and to combat tax fraud and tax evasion. For information about property taxes, local taxes, gift and inheritance taxes consult your local tax office. Each country has its own definition of tax residence, yet: you will usually be considered tax-resident in the country where you spend more than 6 months a year you will normally remain tax-resident in your home country if you spend less than 6 months a year in another EU country.

Still have questions? Search terms Dual residence In some cases, two countries could consider you a tax-resident at the same time, and both could require you to pay taxes on your total worldwide income. Fortunately, many countries have double tax agreements, which usually provide rules to determine which of the two countries can treat you as a resident. If the tax treaty does not provide a solution or if your situation is particularly complicated, contact the tax authorities of one or both countries and ask them to clarify your situation. Posted workers/jobseekers In some cases, such as for workers posted abroad for a limited time or jobseekers abroad, you may be considered tax\u2013resident, and therefore taxable, in your home country even if you stay abroad for more than 6 months - if you keep your permanent home in your home country and your personal and economic ties with that country are stronger. Contact the tax authorities to check which rules apply to you. In such a case, your host country may also tax you - your local employer may, for instance, deduct taxes from your salary at the time of payment. In addition, whether or not you continue to be resident in your home country, that country may tax income (for instance from property) arising there. In these cases, be aware that there are solutions to double taxation and make sure that your income is not taxed twice if it doesn't need to be. Fictitious tax residence Under some double tax treaties, the country where you earn all or almost all of your income will treat you as tax-resident, even if you don't live there. This status of fictitious tax-resident is granted by some countries to cross-border commuters. Under EU rules, each country still has a certain latitude to decide what percentage of your income represents 'almost all'. In any event, whether the country where you earn all or almost all of your income treats you as tax-resident or not, it will be obliged to give you the same allowances and tax reliefs that it gives to a resident. Of course, if you receive all allowances available to residents in the country where you work, you could not expect to receive all allowances and reliefs available to residents in the country where you live as well. Be aware that tax authorities will communicate with each other to ensure that you don't receive a double set of allowances and reliefs. Equal treatment Under EU rules, no matter in which EU country you are considered a tax-resident, you should be taxed in the same way as nationals of that country under the same conditions. For example, in the country where you are tax-resident or where you earn all or most of your income, you should be entitled to: any available family allowances and tax deductions for childcare costs, even if the costs are incurred in another EU country any available tax deductions for interest on mortgages, even for a house you own in another EU country joint tax assessment with your spouse, if this is possible in that country If you feel discriminated against, you can seek personalised advice.

The duration and total amount of the unemployment benefits you are entitled to will remain unchanged. Sample story You are entitled to 8 months unemployment benefits in the country where you became unemployed. You received 2 months' benefits there, then another 2 months' benefits abroad. You are still entitled to 4 months' benefits when you come back. If you did not find a job in the first country you went to, you can go and look in another country. If you want to keep getting your unemployment benefits while abroad, you need to: apply for a U2 form (former E 303 form) - authorisation to export your unemployment benefits - from your national employment services. Warning Ask your job centre whether you'll have to go back home to apply for this new authorisation or you can do it remotely. agree to any checks made on unemployment benefits claimants in the second country, as if you were receiving unemployment benefits there. The total length of your stay abroad (i.e. in all countries) should not exceed 3 months (with a possible extension up to 6 months only if the authority paying your benefits agrees). Staying abroad longer than stated in your U2 form If you stay longer than 3 months in the other country without finding a job and without getting an extension, you will lose your right to all unemployment benefits after the end of the period stated in your U2 form and you will need to re-qualify. This means that you may need to work for some time before you are entitled to unemployment benefits again. If you feel you cannot come back within 3 months, you should contact the employment services in the country where you became unemployed before the 3 months are up, and ask them for an extension. Warning Apply for the extension as early as possible. You must apply for the extension before the end of the initial 3-month period. Sample story Be sure to apply for your extension in time Ram\u00f3n from Spain went to Hungary, taking a U2 form (former E 303 form) with him so he could keep receiving unemployment benefit for 3 months during his stay abroad. But he stayed a bit longer because of an important job interview. When Ram\u00f3n went back to Spain, he had lost his entitlement to unemployment benefit. To avoid this, always apply for an extension from your national employment centre before the end of the 3-month period. They may agree to continue paying your benefits for another 3 months while you look for work abroad. If you haven't received a reply or you are unsure that you will obtain the extension, the best for you is to return before the end of the 3-month period. If you return to your country or you apply for an extension after the initial 3 months are up, you risk having your benefit stopped, like Ram\u00f3n. Even if you are not getting unemployment benefit, you can't be forced to leave your new country as long as you can prove you are still looking for a job and have a good chance of finding one. Warning Keep copies of your job applications, invitations for interviews and any other replies to your applications. Claiming unemployment benefits after working abroad If you lose your job, in general, you should claim unemployment benefits in the country where you last worked. If during your last period of employment or self-employment you were a cross-border worker (living in a different EU country than the one in which you worked and returning there at least once a week), you should claim unemployment benefits in the country where you live, based on your working periods abroad. You will need to request a U1 form (former E 301 form) in the country where you last worked. If during your last period of employment or self-employment you were residing in a different EU country than the one in which you worked but you returned there less than once a week, you can claim unemployment benefits either in your country of residence or in the country where you last worked. If you go back to your country of residence, you will need to request a U1 form (former E 301 form) in the country where you last worked. Even without the form, the authority dealing with your claim can still get the information from other countries directly. But a completed U1 form will probably allow them to process your claim more quickly. To find out about your entitlement to unemployment benefits, it is advisable to contact the national employment services in the country where you want to apply for benefits. Forms you will need U1 form (former E 301 form): statement of periods to be taken into account for granting unemployment benefits. You can get this form from the national employment service of the last country (or countries) where you worked. You should submit it to the national employment service of the country where you apply for benefits. U2 form (former E 303 form): authorisation to export your unemployment benefits to another country. You can get this from the national employment service of the country where you became unemployed. You will have to submit it to the national employment service of the country where you are looking for a job to register as a jobseeker there.

not your nationality. You may not choose which country you will be covered by. When working or living abroad, you will have social security cover by either your home country or the host country. In either case, you'll need to make arrangements to make sure you stay covered after you move to your new country. To avoid potentially serious problems and misunderstandings, find out about social security in your host country. What to do if you are: Living and working abroad As a migrant worker in the EU - employed or self-employed - you should register with the social security system in your host country. You and your dependants will then be covered by that country's social security system. Your benefits related to sickness, family, unemployment, pensions, occupational accidents and diseases, early retirement and death will be determined by the local laws. Qualifying periods In many countries, the benefits you're entitled to may depend on how long you've previously paid contributions for. The country where you claim benefits must take into account all the periods you've worked or all the contributions you've paid in other EU countries as if you'd been covered in that country all along. If it fails to do so, contact our assistance services for help. Sample story Every period of work in the EU counts for benefits Ania from Poland worked 6 years in Poland and then moved to Germany, where she worked for 2 years. She then had a car accident which left her unable to walk, so she applied for an invalidity pension in both Poland and Germany. The German authorities dismissed her application because she'd worked there for less than 5 years (the minimum period to qualify for a German invalidity pension). However, in calculating Ania's working years, the authorities should have included the time she'd worked in Poland. This would have brought the figure to 8 years, well over the German minimum for qualifying. So Ania was actually entitled to an invalidity pension from both Germany and Poland \u2014 each country paying a share proportionate to the years Ania had worked there. Posted abroad on a short assignment If you are an employee or a self-employed professional you can work temporarily as a posted worker\u00a0in another EU country\u00a0but remain covered by the social security system in your home country. This will have no impact on your or your family's social security rights: health cover, family allowances, disability or old-age pension. Access to healthcare services To access healthcare services in the country you're posted to, make sure you get a European Health Insurance Card\u00a0(EHIC). You can get an EHIC from your healthcare provider or the social security authorities in your home country. If, however, you move your residence to your host country, you or your employer should contact the healthcare authorities in your home country and request a Portable Document S1 (PD S1) form instead. You must then register the PD S1 with the host country's healthcare authorities on arrival. Staying covered by the social security system in your home country The PD A1\u00a0form proves that you remain covered by the social security system in your home country while posted to another EU country. The PD A1 form is issued for a maximum period of 24 months. If your posting is longer, you or your employer may request an extension to the validity of your PD A1 form. This is subject to the mutual agreement between the authorities in your home and host countries. If you are an employee, make sure that your employer informs the social security institution in your host country in advance and requests the PD A1 form. If you are self-employed, you must inform the social security institution in your host country in advance, and request a PD A1 form from the social security institution in your home country. To be eligible for the PD A1 form, you have to prove that the activities you intend to pursue abroad are similar to those you pursued in your home country. To meet this requirement, you must: have worked as a self-employed person in your home country. The time period required varies from one EU country to another, but it can be as little as two months. fulfil the requirements to continue working as a self-employed person upon your return to your home country. You should be able to present the PD A1 form to the authorities at any time during your posting abroad, for example, in case of an on the spot check by the labour inspectorate. As long as you have a valid A1 form, the authorities in your host country must recognise it. Postings longer than 24 months As your PD A1 form is valid for only 24 months, if your posting to another EU country lasts longer, you can either: switch to the social security system of your host country and pay contributions there or apply for an extension of your social security cover and remain covered in your home country. A social security cover extension is granted if a mutual agreement between the countries involved in your posting is reached and if the extension is in your interest. To request an extension, you and your employer must contact the competent authority that issued your PD A1 before it expires. When you return to your usual country of work you will be covered by the social security system there.\u00a0You can be posted to another country but only after a certain period of time has elapsed since your return to your home country (two months is considered sufficient by many EU countries). A civil servant seconded abroad If you're a civil servant seconded to work in another EU country (at an embassy, consulate or other official institution abroad), you'll be covered by the social security system of your home country. This means your benefits related to sickness, family, pensions, occupational accidents and diseases, early retirement and death will be determined according to your home country's laws. A different set of rules applies if you become unemployed while on secondment. Working in one country, living in another (cross-border commuter) As a cross-border commuter - whether you are employed or self-employed: You pay social security contributions to and are covered by the EU country where you work You can, however, obtain medical treatment in the country where you live. If you lose your job, you should apply for benefits in the country where you live. Warning Special rules apply to healthcare and unemployment. Make sure you also understand how your pension rights and family benefits will be affected. Sample story Social security contributions - paid only in the country where you work Bal\u00e1zs used to live in Hungary and work in Austria. During that time, he paid his contributions in Austria. However, the Hungarian authorities are now claiming he should have paid contributions in Hungary. Cross-border commuters in the EU are covered under one national social security system only \u2014 in the country where they work. The Hungarian authorities' claim is wrong. Working in more than one country The basic rule is that if you work in more than one EU country, but carry out a substantial part of your professional activities in your country of residence, you are covered by the social security system in your country of residence. Warning A 'substantial part' of your activities means at least 25% of your working time and/or income. If you are self-employed, turnover and the number of services provided can also be relevant when calculating this percentage. Special cases If you... You are covered... are employed but have no substantial activity in your country of residence where your employer's head office or business is located work for two employers with head offices in different countries, one in your country of residence and one outside your country of residence but have no substantial activity in your country of residence where your employer's head office or place of business is located outside your country of residence work for two employers with head offices in different countries outside your country of residence but have no substantial activity in your country of residence in your country of residence are self-employed and have no substantial activity in your country of residence where the centre of interest of your activities is located are employed in one country and carry out self-employed work in another in the country where you are employed Looking for work Receiving unemployment benefit? If you're receiving unemployment benefit from the EU country where you became unemployed, going abroad to look for work won't affect your (or your family's) rights to health cover, family allowance, invalidity or old age pension rights, etc. To ensure that you and your family have health cover during a temporary stay abroad, don't forget to get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). Once you've found a job, various social security rules may apply. Check the rules for your country Not receiving unemployment benefit? If you're not receiving benefit from the EU country where you became unemployed and move to another EU country to look for work, the social security authorities will decide by which social security system you'll be covered (health cover, family allowance, etc\u2026). The social security authorities determine this with the help of a list of criteria including: duration of stay family status and ties housing situation place of latest professional or non-profit activity nature of professional activity where you reside for tax purposes. The country responsible for your social security may make your entitlement to benefits dependent on how long you've previously paid contributions for. However, it will have to take into account all the periods you've worked or all the contributions you've paid in other EU countries as if you'd been covered in that country all along. If it fails to do so, contact our assistance services for help. As a newly-arrived jobseeker, you have a right to reside in that country to look for work for up to 6 months - and longer, if you can prove you're still looking for a job and have a good chance of finding one. So be sure to keep copies of: your job applications any invitations for interview any other replies you receive. Warning EU rules don't oblige your new country to grant income support or any other kind of welfare assistance to jobseekers looking for a job for the first time in that country. Sample story Check whether you're entitled to income support as a jobseeker in your new country Bj\u00f6rn from Germany had been receiving his German unemployment benefits in Belgium. When his U2 form (formerly E 303 form) expired, Bj\u00f6rn decided to stay on in Belgium and apply for income support there. The Belgian authorities turned down his application. Under Belgian law, Bj\u00f6rn wasn't entitled to income support in Belgium, as he'd never worked there. Under EU rules you have no automatic right to income support (or any other kind of assistance) as a first-time jobseeker in another EU country. But you might be entitled under national rules - it's always worth checking with the local authorities. Get access to national information below. Questions on a specific country?

The benefits and the possible recipients differ from one EU country to another. Here are some of the most common benefits you can claim if you are a surviving relative. Survivors' pensions A survivor's pension is a monthly allowance corresponding to a percentage of the pension the deceased received/would have received, and it is paid to their closest surviving relatives. It is granted by the same authority that granted/would have granted their pension. The amount payable is calculated in the same way as for an old-age pension. You have to apply for a survivor's pension to the pension authority in the country where your deceased relative last lived or worked. The national authorities will then review your claim and forward it to the EU country responsible. If you don't meet the national requirements to receive a survivor's pension, you may be able to receive a widowhood allowance. Warning Not all EU countries pay survivors' pensions. Death grants A death grant is a one-time payment after the event of death. Warning Not all EU countries pay death grants. Before you apply for a death grant, you need to check: which country's social insurance system covered your deceased relative whether that country provides death grants what conditions apply to the payment of death grants in that country whether those conditions are met. Where to apply? You should always apply to the social security authority which your deceased relative was registered with - in the country where they last lived. The national authorities will then review your claim and forward it to the EU country responsible. Which country will pay? If your deceased relative received a pension from several EU countries, the country that should pay the death grant and/or the survivor's pension is either: the country where your late relative last lived provided they received a pension from there or the country where they paid social contributions the longest. In either case, you should still file the application to the social security authority which the deceased was registered with, in the country where he/she last lived. Sample story Get to know which country should pay your death grant Els and Jan from the Netherlands moved to Italy when they retired. When Jan died, Els was told she could apply for a Dutch death grant, but she didn't know where she should apply for it. Els contacted a European employment adviser and found out that she should apply to the health insurance authority where her husband was registered in Italy. This administration then forwarded her application to the Dutch authorities. The same rules apply regardless of whether your deceased relative was a pensioner or not. As long as he/she paid social security contributions, you have the right to survivor's benefits. The requirements for receiving a death grant or survivor's pension vary from one EU country to another.

not your nationality. National laws determine the conditions under which parents are paid family benefits. Usually, parents are entitled to benefits in a given EU country: if they work there if they receive a state pension under that country's social security scheme (for example old-age, invalidity or survivor's pension) or simply if they live there. Beware that family benefits differ greatly within Europe. Your entire family lives in one country If you settle with all the members of your family in another EU country and are covered by that country's social security system only, you will be subject to your host country's family benefit regime. However, if you are posted abroad for a short assignment (less than 2 years) while remaining covered by your home country's social security system, your home country will be responsible for paying your family benefits. You and your family members live in different countries If members of your family do not live in the country where you are insured, you could be entitled to family benefits from different countries. The relevant national authorities will then take account of both parents' situations and decide which country has primary responsibility for paying the benefits. Their decision will be based on \"priority rules\". Priority rules Generally, the primary country responsible for providing the benefits is the country where your family's right is based on work (you or your spouse are employed or self-employed) If your right is based on work (employment or self-employment) in both countries, the country where your children live is responsible if one of the parents works there. Otherwise it will be the country where the highest benefits are paid. If your right is based on a pension in both countries, the country where your children live is responsible if this country pays one of the pensions. Otherwise it will be the country where you were insured or have resided the longest. If your right is based on residence in both countries, the country where your children live is primarily responsible. Supplements If the benefits you receive from the \"primary\" country turn out to be lower than what you would have received from the \"secondary\" country where you also had rights, the secondary country will pay a supplement equivalent to the difference between the two benefits. In this way, you are sure of receiving the maximum benefits to which you are entitled. Divorced parents If you are divorced and your ex-husband or ex-wife receives benefits but does not use them to maintain your children, you can contact the family benefits authority in the country where your children live and ask to have the benefits paid direct to you instead, since you are the person who is actually maintaining the family. Where to apply for family benefits? You can apply for family benefits in any EU country where you or your children's other parent are entitled to benefits. The authority in the country in which you apply will share your application with all countries that are competent in your case. If you apply for benefits in due time in one country, you will be considered to have applied in due time in any other EU country in which you have rights to family benefits. You cannot be refused benefits to which you are entitled because the country where you applied initially forwarded your files too late to the competent authority in another country. Warning Check with the national authorities what deadlines apply to family benefits. If you miss the deadline, you could lose your entitlement. National authorities are obliged to cooperate with each other and exchange all the information required to deal with your application. To overcome the difficulties linked to language differences, national administrations use standard documents when exchanging information. Family benefits differ greatly within Europe EU countries are free to establish their own rules on entitlement to benefits and services. All countries offer some family benefits but amounts and conditions differ widely. In some countries you will receive regular payments, while in others your family situation may give rise to tax benefits rather than payments. To avoid potentially serious misunderstandings that could have a significant impact on your overall income, find out about the social security system in your host country. Here you can find specific information on family benefits in the country that is responsible for paying them to you: Choose country: Austriaaten Belgiumbeen Bulgariabgen Croatiacren Cypruscyen Denmarkdken Estoniaeeen Finlandfien Francefren Germanydeen Greecegren Hungaryhuen Icelandisen Irelandieen Italyiten Latvialven Liechtensteinlien Lithuanialten Luxembourgluen Maltamten Netherlandsnlen Norwaynoen Polandplen Portugalpten Romaniaroen Slovakiasken Sloveniasien Spainesen Swedenseen Switzerlandchen Still have questions?

Each EU country has its own laws determining: what benefits you're entitled to, how much you'll receive and for how long how long you must work there before qualifying for unemployment benefits, the rules for calculating benefits and the duration of the benefits. Warning EU rules only determine which country's social security covers you when 2 or more countries are involved. As a rule, you're covered by the legislation of just 1 country at a time and only pay contributions in that country; you should be treated the same as nationals of that country. Warning Benefit systems in your host country may be very different from what you are used to at home. Misunderstandings could have serious consequences \u2014 so make sure you check which benefits you're entitled to in your host country. Sample story Each country has its own rules for awarding benefits Line from Denmark was living and working in Cyprus when she lost her job and applied for unemployment benefit there. She was disappointed when she found out she would only be paid for 156 days. In Denmark, the benefit would have run up to 4 years. She never suspected the difference would be so big. Useful forms To be able to move from one country's benefits system to another, you may need to submit forms that certify your benefits situation when you arrive.

However, under certain conditions, you can go to another EU country to look for work and continue to receive your unemployment benefits from the country where you became unemployed. Staying abroad for 3 months You can carry on receiving your unemployment benefit for at least 3 months from the EU country where you were last working - and up to a maximum of 6 months, depending on the institution paying your benefit. You can only do this if you are: wholly unemployed (not partially or intermittently) and entitled to receive unemployment benefits in the country where you became unemployed. Before leaving, you must: have been registered as an unemployed jobseeker with the employment services in the country where you became unemployed for at least 4 weeks (exceptions can be made) apply to your national employment services for a U2 form (formerly E 303) - an authorisation to export your unemployment benefits. Warning This authorisation is valid for one country only. If you wish to export your unemployment benefits to another country, you need to apply for another U2 form. Ask your jobcentre whether you have to go back home to apply for this new authorisation or whether you can do it remotely. On arrival in the new country, you'll need to: register as a jobseeker with the national employment services within 7 days from the date on which you ceased to be available to the employment services in the country you left submit your U2 form (formerly E 303) when you register agree to any checks made on unemployment benefit claimants in your new country as if you were receiving unemployment benefits there. Warning You are advised to find out about your rights and duties as a jobseeker in your new country. They may be very different from the country where you became unemployed. The same amount as before will then be paid directly into your bank account in the country where you became unemployed. Warning If you want to keep your entitlement to unemployment benefits, be sure to return to the country paying your unemployment benefits before or on the day your entitlement expires. Staying abroad longer than 3 months If you want to stay abroad for longer than 3 months, you will need to apply for an extension from the national employment service in the country where you became unemployed: they may extend the 3-month period up to 6 months. Warning Not all countries grant extensions. Ask the public employment service in your home country if, and under what conditions, extensions can be granted. Most of the countries granting extensions have clear criteria for assessing requests. They could, for instance, ask you for: evidence of any efforts you made to find a job during the first 3 months evidence that you have a better chance of finding a job abroad during the extended period information about job opportunities on your host country's labour market. Apply for the extension as early as possible. You must apply before the end of the initial 3-month period. Equal treatment When looking for work abroad, you have the same rights as nationals of your host country with regard to: access to work support from employment services financial support to help you find work Warning Your new country might wait until you have established a genuine link with the local employment market before granting some types of financial support to help you find work \u2014 such as low-interest loans for unemployed people starting a business. Being in the country and looking for work for a reasonable amount of time may count as a genuine link.

not your nationality. What to do if - before losing your job - you were: Living & working abroad Planning to stay? If you lose your job and choose to stay on in the EU country where you were employed, you should claim unemployment benefits there. Register as a jobseeker with the local employment services. You will be treated the same as nationals of that country. Pay special attention to: periods of work required to qualify for unemployment benefit applicable rates for calculating the benefit duration of the benefit If you need to certify any previous periods of employment and social security cover abroad, you may need to apply for a U1 form (formerly E 301 form) in the country where you worked before. Even if you don't submit a U1 form, the claim handlers can get the information directly from the other country's authorities. However, the form could help speed up processing. Going back home? If, after losing your job, you choose to go back to your home country, you must contact the national employment service there to find out if you're still entitled to unemployment benefits after your time abroad. If you are, you'll need to: register directly as a jobseeker in your home country, and apply for a U1 form (formerly E 301 form) in the country where you last worked. Even if you don't submit a U1 form, the claim handlers can get the information directly from the other country's authorities. However, the form could help speed up processing. If you're not entitled to benefits in your country of origin, you can apply for an authorisation to transfer your unemployment benefit from the country where you became unemployed either: back to your home country, or to any other country where you wish to look for a job Benefits are usually transferred for 3 months, but this may be extended to a maximum period of 6 months. Posted abroad on a short assignment (<2 years) If you chose to remain covered in the country from which you were posted, your unemployment benefit should be paid there. In this case, you should register as a jobseeker with the employment services in that country. A civil servant seconded abroad If you become wholly unemployed, you can choose to receive unemployment benefits in either the EU country you were posted to or your home country - by registering with the employment services in either country. If you decide to apply for benefits in the country you were posted to, ask the national employment service in your home country for a U1 form (formerly E 301 form). This form shows the periods to be considered when calculating unemployment benefits. Send it to the national employment service in the country where you are applying for benefits. Even if you don't submit a U1 form, the claim handlers can get the information directly from the other country's authorities. However, the form could help speed up processing. If you decide to apply for benefits in your home country, you will have to go back there. Your benefits will be calculated in accordance with the rules of the country where you register as a jobseeker, taking account of any periods worked abroad. Sample story Think twice where you register as unemployed Mirko from Germany was working as a German civil servant in Ireland when he lost his job. He could have gone back to Germany and registered as a jobseeker there. However, he chose to stay in Ireland and to apply for unemployment benefits there. He expected to receive around 67% of his average daily wage, as is usual in Germany. But in Ireland, unemployment benefits are not based on previous earnings. Mirko was very surprised to find he was only entitled to a weekly flat-rate sum of \u20ac204.30. Working in one country, living in another (cross-border commuter) If you are a cross-border commuter\u00a0(either employed or self-employed) and lose your job, you can only claim unemployment benefits in the country where you're living. Warning Exception If, during your last period of commuting, you went home less than once a week, you can choose where to claim unemployment benefits (country of residence or country where you last worked). This has been the rule since 1 May 2010, although some job centres still might not be aware of it. If you have problems with payment of your unemployment benefit abroad, contact our assistance services for help. Amount Whether you're entitled to unemployment benefit, and how much will depend on the rules in the country where you live and the time you've worked abroad. Ask the authorities in the country (or countries) you've worked in for a U1 form (formerly E 301 form - showing periods to be considered when calculating unemployment benefits). Send this form to the national employment services in the country where you wish to apply for benefits, so they can take account of any periods of social security cover or employment in other countries. Even if you don't complete a U1 form, the claim handlers can get the information directly from the other countries' authorities. However, the form could help speed up processing. Need help to find work? If you need help finding a new job in the country where you lost your job, you can register as a jobseeker with the national employment service there. You will then have to comply with requirements in both countries: country of residence (paying your benefit) and country where you last worked (where you are also looking for a job). Warning Meeting the requirements of the country where you live is most important - if you don't, your benefits could be affected. Sample story Check where you can apply for unemployment benefits Arthur from Germany lost his job in 2008 and moved straight to Hungary to work there. He got a 1-year employment contract in Budapest, but kept his home in Germany and went back there on a regular basis. When he lost his job again, he could have applied for benefits in Hungary. However, he decided to go back to Germany and had no trouble getting the benefit there. Warning Different country, different benefits Each EU country has its own rules on unemployment benefits. This means you might get benefit for 24 months in your home country but just 12 months in another.

Your right to work in some EU countries might be temporarily restricted if you are a national of Croatia. EU countries may still reserve certain jobs for their own nationals, but only if they involve: the exercise of public authority powers the safeguard of general interests of the state. These are typically posts in the diplomatic service, the armed forces, police and security forces, judiciary and tax authorities. But even there, positions not involving the exercise of public authority must be open to other EU nationals. For example, administrative and technical-support jobs do not involve exercising those powers, so those jobs cannot be reserved for country's own nationals. To get a job in the public sector, you may need official recognition of your qualifications in the country where you want to work. Your new country cannot give you less credit for your professional experience just because you gained it in another EU country when it comes to: deciding what posts you are eligible for when seniority or experience are required to take part in a recruitment competition determining your salary, grade or other conditions. Sample story Your experience in the EU counts Elisa from France worked as a teacher in France for 10 years before she moved to Italy. Her qualification to work as a teacher was recognised by Italy, but the Italian authorities considered her to be a beginner and put her in the lowest grade of seniority and pay. If seniority and pay of teachers in Italy are determined by\u00a0taking into account the\u00a0years of professional experience, Italy must give Elisa the same credit for the comparable experience she acquired in another EU country.

In everyday life, you are subject to the laws of both countries. The laws where you work cover: employment and income taxes most social security rights The laws where you live cover: property taxes and most other taxes residence formalities Sample story Make sure you don't lose out if you have worked in another country Evelien from the Netherlands worked as a cross-border commuter in Germany for 10 years. In that time, she set up a German private pension and obtained a savings-pension bonus from the German authorities. When she retired, the German authorities asked her to pay back all savings-pension bonuses she had been paid over the past 10 years. They said it was because she had stopped paying taxes in Germany. But as soon as Evelien stopped working in Germany, she had to pay taxes in her country of residence, the Netherlands. Evelien took this matter to the German courts. They agreed that, as a cross-border commuter, she was entitled to the bonus, which counts as a supplementary benefit. Evelien did not have to pay back the bonus. If you are refused a supplementary benefit granted to workers in the country where you work, contact a European employment adviser or our information and assistance services. Sample story Benefits you are entitled to in the country where you work Rosita lives in Italy with her husband and 3 children but works in France. She applies for a discounted train pass for large families but had it refused because neither she nor her children live in France. Rosita should insist and, if necessary, seek help from the various EU assistance services. All EU workers with large families (in many countries, 3 or more children) are entitled to cheaper train travel in the country where they work from the day they start work \u2014 if such reductions are available to nationals of that country. Bank account for salary payments Your employer might want you to open a bank account in your country of employment to pay your salary. Inside the eurozone \u2014 Your account in your home country should be sufficient and your employer cannot force you \u2014 provided both your country of residence and country of employment are in the eurozone. All your employer needs to transfer your salary \u2014 without any additional costs \u2014 is the IBAN and BIC numbers for your bank account. Banks cannot charge more for international bank transfers in euro than for purely national transfers. If you live or work in a country outside the eurozone, it might be legitimate for your employer to require you to have a local bank account if he/she\u00a0can prove that it will cost him more to transfer your salary abroad.

Discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of age, sex, disability, ethnic or racial origin, religion or belief, or sexual orientation is banned across the EU in both the public and private sector. As an EU national, you must also be treated in exactly the same way as your local colleagues who are citizens of the country when it comes to working rights, social benefits and access to public employment services. However, your host country may decide to withhold your entitlement to income support \u2014 or other benefits \u2014 for the first 3 months of your residence (for example if you came as a seasonal worker, worked 1 month and then applied for income support), and for even longer if you arrive in the country as a job-seeker. What types of discrimination are you protected against? Check types of discrimination Reasonable accommodation If you have a disability, you may need adjustments to your job or workplace to perform and to advance in job functions or undertake training. In that case, you can request that your employer takes reasonable steps to accommodate your condition. Such steps can apply to all work-related activities, from the job application process to termination, working conditions and fringe benefits. How to enforce your rights If you believe that you have been discriminated against, you can bring your case to a national equality body. Some may simply provide you with useful information regarding your situation, while others can help you make a complaint. They may even, with your approval, take your case to the competent courts. Depending on the national legislation, you may be entitled to compensation, reinstatement in a job, or an order requiring the employer to remedy the discrimination and provide reasonable accommodation. You can also contact organisations such as trade unions, NGOs and lawyers \u200bfor help and advice. Get access to national information below. Questions on a specific country?

border crossing restrictions for posted workers Your employer can send you to work temporarily in another EU country. During this period, you will acquire the status of a posted worker and will benefit from the same basic working conditions and rights as workers in your host country. A posting can last as long as it is necessary to complete a specific task. When your posting has finished, you should return to your workplace in the EU country where you were posted from. Working conditions You will fall under the terms and conditions of employment of your host country if they are more advantageous than those of your home country. These conditions and terms of employment relate to: All the basic elements of remuneration as defined in national law or universally applicable collective agreements Allowances or the reimbursement of expenses to cover travel, board and lodging costs in the host country during the posting (if you are required to travel during the posting assignment) Maximum work periods Minimum rest periods Health and safety at work Conditions on hiring workers, in particular through agencies providing temporary staff Employment conditions for pregnant women, women who have recently given birth and young people (under the age of 18) Equal treatment for men and women and other rules to prevent discrimination Accommodation, if provided by your employer Other rights While posted to another EU country: you won't need a work permit you won't need to have your professional qualifications recognised; however, you may need to make a written declaration for some professions: find out more about the recognition of professional qualifications you do not need to register with the social security authorities in the country where you have been posted, since you remain insured in the country where you are normally employed. Therefore during your posting you do not accumulate any additional social security rights such as pension rights or the right to unemployment benefits in the country where you have been posted. you must register your residence with the authorities if your posting is longer than 3 months you won't accumulate the right to permanent residence in your host country. Long term posting If you are posted for more than 12 months (or 18 months if your employer submits a motivated notification to your host country's national authorities) all relevant terms and conditions of employment of your host country apply, with the exception of those relating to the termination of contracts and supplementary working pensions. If you are posted to another EU country for a long period of time you may want your family to join you there, they can do so by virtue of their own EU citizens' rights, but not as your dependants. Income tax If you work in your host country for less than six months, you shouldn't be liable for income tax there. However, there are no EU-wide rules that set out which country can tax your income during a posting. This may be set out in national laws or tax agreements between EU countries. Social security cover while abroad As a posted worker, to continue to be covered by the social security system in your home country, your employer has to request a PD A1 form from the social security institution in your home country and inform the host country\u00b4s authorities. If your posting lasts longer than 2 years, you can either: switch to the social security system of the country where you are posted or ask your employer to apply for the extension of the validity of your social security form posting period to remain covered in your home country. The extension will be granted if a mutual agreement is reached between the authorities in both countries and it is in your interest. Find out more about your social security cover while on a posting to another EU country. Before your posting Your employer may also need to send a notification to the authorities in your host country with the following details about: your workplace the duration of your posting your contact information, and any other relevant specifics.

If instead, you are working in your host country for a local public sector body without being a national of the country, you will count as a migrant worker. Make sure you check: what impact living and/or working in another EU country will have on your social security: healthcare unemployment family benefits retirement where you will have to pay taxes during your stay abroad Access to jobs in the public sector As an EU national, you have the right to work in another EU country, including in the public sector \u2014 that is, for example, in state-owned companies, government bodies and public authorities. EU countries may still reserve certain jobs for their own nationals, but only if they involve: the exercise of public authority powers the safeguard of general interests of the state. These are typically posts in the diplomatic service, the armed forces, police and security forces, judiciary and tax authorities. But even there, positions not involving the exercise of public authority must be open to other EU nationals. For example, administrative and technical-support jobs do not involve exercising those powers, so those jobs cannot be reserved for country's own nationals. To get a job in the public sector, you may need official recognition of your qualifications in the country where you want to work. Your new country cannot give you less credit for your professional experience just because you gained it in another EU country when it comes to: deciding what posts you are eligible for when seniority or experience are required to take part in a recruitment competition determining your salary, grade or other conditions. Warning As an EU national looking for a job in another EU country, you are also entitled to the same assistance from public employment services\u00a0as nationals of that\u00a0country. Sample story Your experience in the EU counts Elisa from France worked as a teacher in France for 10 years before she moved to Italy. Her qualification to work as a teacher was recognised by Italy, but the Italian authorities considered her to be a beginner and put her in the lowest grade of seniority and pay. If seniority and pay of teachers in Italy are determined by\u00a0taking into account the\u00a0years of professional experience, Italy must give Elisa the same credit for the comparable experience she acquired in another EU country.
